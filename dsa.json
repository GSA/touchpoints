We also support food insecure refugees fleeing war, violence, or persecution.","tags":[{"id":1528,"name":"humanitarian","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.507Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.507Z","taggings_count":2},{"id":1527,"name":"disasters","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.505Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.505Z","taggings_count":4}],"id":"2050"},{"name":"Department of Labor","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"github","service_url":"http://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor","account":"USDepartmentofLabor","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":null,"long_description":null,"tags":[{"id":113,"name":"API","created_at":"2022-03-23T17:10:50.199Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T17:10:50.199Z","taggings_count":12},{"id":1482,"name":"open","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:12.434Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:12.434Z","taggings_count":9},{"id":1121,"name":"code","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:56.592Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:56.592Z","taggings_count":38},{"id":471,"name":"technology","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:25.164Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:25.164Z","taggings_count":76}],"id":"2051"},{"name":"USGS Wetlands","agencies":[{"id":2104,"name":"US Geological Survey","url":"https://www.usgs.gov/","abbreviation":"USGS","domain":"usgs.gov","logo":{"url":null,"thumb":{"url":null},"card":{"url":null},"tag":{"url":null},"logo_square":{"url":null}},"digital_analytics_path":null,"mission_statement":null,"mission_statement_url":null,"performance_url":null,"strategic_plan_url":null,"learning_agenda_url":null}],"contacts":[{"email":"everettel@usgs.gov"},{"email":"shorvath@usgs.gov"}],"service":"twitter","service_url":"http://twitter.com/usgswetlands","account":"usgswetlands","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"","long_description":"","tags":[{"id":458,"name":"ecosystems","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:24.992Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:24.992Z","taggings_count":37},{"id":457,"name":"water","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:24.990Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:24.990Z","taggings_count":50},{"id":947,"name":"coastal","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:50.725Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:42:50.725Z","taggings_count":8},{"id":1535,"name":"wetlands","created_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.846Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:43:13.846Z","taggings_count":2},{"id":402,"name":"science","created_at":"2022-10-19T16:55:36.448Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T16:55:36.448Z","taggings_count":201},{"id":185,"name":"environment","created_at":"2022-05-25T16:54:09.470Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T16:54:09.470Z","taggings_count":135}],"id":"2063"},{"name":"NCI Physical Sciences","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"http://twitter.com/NCIPhySci","account":"NCIPhySci","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Twitter account of the NCI Physical Sciences-Oncology Network.

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

The Act authorized the designation of National Marine Sanctuaries to protect: significant waters and secure habitat for aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing, wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism.\r\n\r\nThe National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 14 marine protected areas that encompass more than 150,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Florida Keys, and from Lake Huron to American Samoa. The system includes 13 national marine sanctuaries and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.\r\n\r\nDesignated in 1981, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) spanned 1,279-square-miles (966 square nautical miles) just north and west of San Francisco Bay, and protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, GFNMS expanded north and west of their original boundaries to encompass 3,295 square miles, and changed their name to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. GFNMS has administrative jurisdiction over the northern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz County line northward to the existing boundary between the two sanctuaries. GFNMS maintains an administrative office and public Visitor Center on Crissy Field in the Presidio of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nGFNMS is located within the California Current ecosystem, one of four major eastern boundary currents in the world, that stretches along the western coast of North America from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Due to a high degree of wind-driven upwelling, there is a ready supply of nutrients to surface waters and the California Current ecosystem is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world.\r\n\r\nGFNMS is a globally significant, extraordinarily diverse, and productive marine ecosystem that supports abundant wildlife and valuable fisheries. It provides breeding and feeding grounds for at least twenty-five endangered or threatened species; thirty-six marine mammal species, including blue, gray, and humpback whales, harbor seals, elephant seals, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and one of the southernmost U.S. populations of threatened Steller sea lions; over a quarter-million breeding seabirds; and one of the most significant white shark populations on the planet.","tags":[],"id":"3715"},{"name":"Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/hawaiihumpbackwhale","account":"hawaiihumpbackwhale","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Humpback Whale NMS in Hawaii","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"3716"},{"name":"MBNMS","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MBNMS","account":"MBNMS","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"NOAA's Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary","long_description":"Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS), designated in 1992, is a federally protected marine area offshore of California's central coast.

For centuries people have been drawn to the river for food and transportation and for power to sustain the mills, factories and homes built along its banks.\r\n\r\nToday the river attracts us for different reasons. People come to float down the river, hike the trails along its banks, play touch football in the meadows, and simply relax.

The refuge’s three units, Big Sandy, Duck River, and Busseltown, stretch for 65 miles along the Tennessee River. Established in 1945, the refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge provides a major wintering area for migrating waterfowl. Currently the refuge habitats include agricultural crops; natural plants that grown in moist soil conditions, vegetated wetlands, and forest lands. The resulting combination of agricultural grains, natural foods and protected areas sustains waterfowl through the winter months. The refuge also provides habitat for resident wildlife species and other migratory birds. The refuge’s diversity of habitats also supports breeding, wintering and migration habitat for 301 bird species and habitat for 51 mammals, 89 reptiles and amphibians and 144 species of fish. White-tailed deer can be found throughout the area, along with smaller animals such as raccoons, foxes, squirrels, beaver, rabbits and wild turkey. In addition to being a home to wildlife, the refuge offers many recreational opportunities such as: hunting, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, and photography. The refuge offers three hiking trails, four wildlife observation decks, multiple boat ramps and fishing decks. The refuge also provides the perfect outdoor classroom for environmental education and interpretation activities. Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge is open during daylight hours.

Chavez monument in California, to the legacy captured at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington D.C., our federal lands and waters should be experienced and enjoyed by every American, especially our youth. \r\nTo ensure continued preservation so the next generation can experience and enjoy all these places have to offer, we must look to a future generation of stewards who can lead the charge. That is why the Every Kid in a Park Initiative is an effort to inspire every child to get outside and learn about the rich history and culture of our nation and the natural wonders of our federal lands and waters.\r\nThe Every Kid in a Park initiative grants every 4th grader in the country and their family, free access to these beautiful places for one full year. \r\nOur federal lands and waters also serve as an innovative resource educators can use to inspire learning in important subjects like history, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts and can help make teaching and learning fun. Educators interested in taking advantage of this special teaching and learning opportunity can go to the website to access fun and engaging learning activities, aligned to standard.","tags":[],"id":"10350"},{"name":"USDA-NRCS

Currently around 90 volunteers serve in one of three technical sectors: Education, Health, and Environment. Due to the size of The Gambia (it is the smallest country in mainland Africa) volunteers are able to collaborate on many projects, with particularly strong cross-sector initiatives in the areas of Gender-and-Development (GAD) and Food Security.\r\n\r\nPeace Corps Volunteers come from diverse backgrounds in the United States. They represent a wide range of ages, religions, and ethnicities, and have vastly differing skills and experience. But they have all come with one thing in common: they want to learn about The Gambia and Gambians and share their skills to effect change.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Peace Corps Volunteer in The Gambia lives with a host family in a mud or concrete block compound. This proximity, sharing meals and becoming part of a family, helps volunteers to learn Gambian culture and language and to develop close ties to their communities – an integral factor in the development work that they undertake.\r\n\r\nTake a look at some of the projects we’re involved in – we’ll update our Facebook page with stories, pictures, news articles, and Peace Corps events.

It was a simple structure manned by a single keeper and sparsely equipped. In case of an emergency, the keeper had to rouse a volunteer crew before any rescue attempt. In 1892, Station Coos Bay was moved from the lighthouse to the North Spit of Coos Bay and was a fully manned station. The station moved again in 1915. This time it moved from the North Spit to the lee side of Coos Head promontory. A larger station was built consisting of a main administration building and quarters, a boathouse, a workshop and one house reserved for the officerin charge. The last move for Station Coos Bay was in 1968, to its present location at Charleston Boat Basin.","tags":[],"id":"10688"},{"name":"U.S. Coast Guard Station Depoe Bay","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/uscoastguardstadepoebayofficial","account":"uscoastguardstadepoebayofficial","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Welcome to the U.S. Coast Guard Station Depoe Bay page.

In August of 1961, Ghana became the first country in the world to receive Peace Corps Volunteers. After nearly 54 years of uninterrupted collaboration, we have roughly 130 Volunteers serving in all 10 regions of the country, at any given time. Our volunteers generally serve in three capacity building sectors: health, education and agriculture. Additionally, the majority of our volunteers work in one or more of the following cross-sector initiatives: HIV/AIDS Awareness & Prevention; Food Security; and Gender & Youth Development.\r\n\r\nThe goals of Peace Corps Ghana are to promote sustainable development, and to build mutual cultural understanding on the part of Americans and Ghanaians. We achieve these goals by encouraging our volunteers to work with community members to address issues in ways that are sensitive to the cultural values and consistent with the available resources of their communities. Our volunteers supplement host country efforts, they do not serve as a substitute for those efforts. Our volunteers work with an aim of reducing dependency through achievement of developmental goals defined by the Ghanaian government.\r\n\r\nWe believe that \"development\" is a learning process, in which the people involved are developing skills, know-how, confidence, and the ability to identify and address issues that affect them on a daily basis. Peace Corps Ghana is proud of the role that we have played in Ghana’s development as an independent nation. We look forward to remaining an active partner with Ghana as she strives towards achieving \"middle income country\" status by 2020.","tags":[],"id":"10948"},{"name":"PCV Media","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"youtube","service_url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/PCAVGhana","account":"pcavghana","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Peace Corps Ghana and PCV Media would like to share our high-quality material filmed and produced by Peace Corps Volunteers to educate and inspire.","long_description":"Peace Corps Ghana and PCV Media would like to share our high-quality material filmed and produced by Peace Corps Volunteers to educate and inspire.\r\n\r\nMission\r\nIn 1961, President John F.

At NINDS, we look at all aspects of brain science, from the molecular building blocks that form brain cells and their connections to the effectiveness of a treatment on hundreds of people suffering from a neurological disease.\r\n\r\nThat’s where Brain for Life comes in.

","long_description":"In 2006 the National Institute of Health (NIH) developed the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) Research Grant Program to foster the research and development of new and improved therapeutics to reduce mortality and morbidity during and/or after civilian chemical emergency events. To date, there has been considerable progress in the areas of target identification, hit and lead development, and preclinical studies. Investigators have identified several molecular entities that show promise as novel targets for therapeutic discovery and development. In vitro and in vivo models for screening are being developed and validated against human and animal efficacy studies. These models have produced several novel compounds with biological activity that is now being tested in proof-of-principle studies with more advanced animal models. There has also been progress in developing new indications for several FDA-approved drugs. Investigators have published over 800 articles in some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals in science, including reports of important discoveries that have implications beyond chemical defense. Over a half dozen compounds have been identified as lead compounds, and several meetings (pre-IND, IND, and NDA) with the FDA have already occurred. One drug is poised for possible FDA approval and government procurement for the SNS very soon. \r\n\r\nSee http://www.ninds.nih.gov/counteract for specific aspects of the NIH CounterACT portfolio, possible avenues for fruitful collaborations, and active funding opportunity announcements","tags":[],"id":"11144"},{"name":"NINDS Director","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/nindsdirector","account":"nindsdirector","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Twitter account for NINDS Director, Walter J.

Of the nearly 90,000 Tribal members that make up the 24 Tribes under the Southern Plains jurisdiction, 55,000 live within the three State service areas, which stretch from the Texas/Mexico border, across West central Oklahoma before finally ending in Northern Kansas.\r\nWithin that area the Southern Plains Regional Office (SPRO) is located in Anadarko, Oklahoma as is the Anadarko Agency. The additional three agencies under the SPRO are the Pawnee Agency located in Pawnee, Oklahoma, the Concho Agency located in El Reno, Oklahoma, and the Horton Agency located in Horton, Kansas. The service area is comprised of 585,000 acres of Trust property contained within 13,000 highly fractionated tracts. This high fractionation makes for a challenging work environment at the Regional Office and the individual Agencies.\r\nThe following tribes are serviced under the Southern Plains Regional Office:\r\nAlabama-Coushatta Tribe - Located in Livingston, Texas with 993 enrolled members\r\nKickapoo Traditional Tribe - Located in Eagle Pass, Texas with 880 enrolled members\r\nAbsentee Shawnee Tribe - Located in Shawnee, Oklahoma with 2,926 enrolled members\r\nCitizen Potawatomi Nation - Located in Shawnee, Oklahoma with 23,557 enrolled members\r\nDelaware Nation of Western OK - Located in Anadarko, Oklahoma with 1,302 enrolled members\r\nKaw Nation - Located in Kaw City, Oklahoma with 2,553 enrolled members\r\nKickapoo Tribe - Located in McLoud, Oklahoma with 2,505 enrolled members\r\nSac and Fox Nation - Located in Stroud, Oklahoma with 3,025 enrolled members\r\nBranch of Natural Resources, Division of Wildland Fire Management\r\nThe Division provides services related to planning, coordination, and evaluating programs in the fields of Natural Resources, Forestry and Wildland Fire Management while providing assistance to protect and enhance the value of Indian Trust assets. Emphasis is placed on improving these resources through hazardous fuels reduction, Reserved Treaty Rights Lands projects, and assisting agricultural programs through prescribed burning. While hazardous fuels removal (Eastern Red Cedar eradication) is the main driver, the Wildland Fire Management program provides suppression resources for local wildland fires and supports Oklahoma Forestry Service, Volunteer Fire Departments, Tribal Departments, and other Federal Interagency Partners within the State.

This place where our nation began arouses deep feelings. The attentive silence of the crowds in the Assembly Room is a testament to this emotion. So is the awe on the faces of children as they view the Liberty Bell for the first time. But Independence is more than an object of reverence. It is also a place to be reminded of the ideals that formed the basis for the founding of the United States, and on which its continued survival depends. And as they tour the park, visitors are made aware that the formation of this nation was the work of men, imperfect like themselves, who transcended their faults and foibles to create an enduring democracy, the oldest in the world and a model for free men everywhere.","tags":[],"id":"11813"},{"name":"@INDEPENDENCENHP","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/INDEPENDENCENHP","account":"independencenhp","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The Liberty Bell cracked long ago, but its voice has never been stilled.

Usually clear, cold, and slow-moving, the river sometimes plunges as a muddy torrent through its rockbound shoals. For centuries people have been drawn to the river for food and transportation and for power to sustain the mills, factories and homes built along its banks. Today the river attracts us for different reasons. People come to float down the river, hike the trails along its banks, play touch football in the meadows, and simply relax. In its role as and outdoor classroom, the park promises to expand your horizons through nature walks exploring its plants and birds and the river.","tags":[],"id":"11893"},{"name":"Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/OrganPipeNPS","account":"organpipenps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11894"},{"name":"Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/organpipenps","account":"organpipenps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11895"},{"name":"Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument ","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"https://www.instagram.com/organpipenps/","account":"organpipenps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11896"},{"name":"anti1862nps","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"https://www.instagram.com/anti1862nps/?hl=en","account":"anti1862nps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"photo journal of park","long_description":"platform is used to post current and historic images of Antietam National Battlefield and Cemetery","tags":[],"id":"11901"},{"name":"Shiloh National Military Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"http://instagram.com/shilohnps","account":"shilohnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The official Instgram account for SHIL","long_description":"The official Instagram account for SHIL","tags":[],"id":"11902"},{"name":"Shiloh National Military Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"youtube","service_url":"http://www.youtube.com/shilohnps1862","account":"shilohnps1862","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The official Youtube account of SHIL","long_description":"The official Youtube account of SHIL","tags":[],"id":"11903"},{"name":"Shiloh National Military Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ShilohNMP","account":"shilohnmp","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The official Facebook account of SHIL","long_description":"The official Facebook account of SHIL","tags":[],"id":"11904"},{"name":"Shiloh National Military Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/shilohnps","account":"shilohnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The official Twittter account of SHIL","long_description":"The official Twitter account of SHIL","tags":[],"id":"11905"},{"name":"National Park Service Museum Management Program","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/NPSmuseum","account":"npsmuseum","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"NPS MMP Facebook","long_description":"National Park Service Museum Management Program Facebook account","tags":[],"id":"11906"},{"name":"NPS Museum Management Program Instagram","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"https://www.instagram.com/NPSmuseum/","account":"npsmuseum","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"NPS MMP Instagram","long_description":"NPS Museum Management Program Instagram Account","tags":[],"id":"11907"},{"name":"National Historic Landmarks Program","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/NationalHistoricLandmarksProgram","account":"nationalhistoriclandmarksprogram","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Facebook account to share information about NHLs","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11908"},{"name":"NHLs","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"flickr","service_url":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalregister/sets/72157615887458914/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Collection of NHL images","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11909"},{"name":"National Historic Landmarks Program","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"pinterest","service_url":"https://www.pinterest.com/nhlprogram/pins/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Pinterest board for NHLs","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"11910"},{"name":"National Park Service -

Records on more than 40,000 historic sites (consisting of large-format black and white photographs, measured drawings, and written historical reports) are maintained in a special collection at the Library of Congress, available to the public copyright free in both hard copy (at the Library of Congress) and via the Library's website. HDP also develops and maintains the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architectural and Engineering Documentation.\r\n\r\nHDP conducts a nationwide documentation program in partnership with state and local governments, private industry, professional societies, universities, preservation groups, and other Federal agencies. The program assigns highest priority to sites that are in danger of demolition or loss by neglect, and to National Park Service properties. In addition to the summer recording program, documentation enters the Collection through mitigation activities under appropriate sections of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, submissions in prize competitions, and donations.\r\n\r\nDocumentation provides a permanent record of the nation's most important historic sites and large-scale objects. The Collection is unique in the strong support it enjoys from its institutional sponsors and the public, and is distinguished in its national scope, consistent format, archival stability, and continued growth. The documentation contributes to wider recognition and appreciation of historic resources as National Historic Landmarks, provides baseline documentation for rehabilitation and restoration, and makes available well-researched materials for interpretation and illustration. Unsurprisingly, it is the most heavily used collection at the Library of Congress' Division of Prints and Photographs.","tags":[],"id":"12008"},{"name":"Mojave Desert Network I&M","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"http://instagram.com/mojnnps","account":"mojnnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Insta account for the NPS Mojave Desert Inventory & Monitoring Network.

It administers the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), the Federal Government's oldest preservation program, and its companion programs: the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) and the Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS). Documentation produced through HABS/HAER/HALS constitutes the nation's largest archive of historic architectural, engineering, and landscape documentation. Records on more than 40,000 historic sites (consisting of large-format black and white photographs, measured drawings, and written historical reports) are maintained in a special collection at the Library of Congress, available to the public copyright free in both hard copy (at the Library of Congress) and via the Library's website. HDP also develops and maintains the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architectural and Engineering Documentation.\r\n\r\nHDP conducts a nationwide documentation program in partnership with state and local governments, private industry, professional societies, universities, preservation groups, and other Federal agencies. The program assigns highest priority to sites that are in danger of demolition or loss by neglect, and to National Park Service properties. In addition to the summer recording program, documentation enters the Collection through mitigation activities under appropriate sections of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, submissions in prize competitions, and donations.\r\n\r\nDocumentation provides a permanent record of the nation's most important historic sites and large-scale objects. The Collection is unique in the strong support it enjoys from its institutional sponsors and the public, and is distinguished in its national scope, consistent format, archival stability, and continued growth. The documentation contributes to wider recognition and appreciation of historic resources as National Historic Landmarks, provides baseline documentation for rehabilitation and restoration, and makes available well-researched materials for interpretation and illustration. Unsurprisingly, it is the most heavily used collection at the Library of Congress' Division of Prints and Photographs.","tags":[],"id":"12012"},{"name":"Cane River Creole National Historical Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"http://instagram.com/canerivercreolenps/","account":"canerivercreolenps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"This is the official Instagram page of Cane River Creole National Historical Park","long_description":"Experience history when you visit Cane River Creole National Historical Park's Oakland and Magnolia Plantations, located near historic Natchitoches, LA.

Although there are over 3,700 acres within the park's authorized boundary, over half of this is still privately owned. Therefore, much of the battlefield is not accessible to the public. Nearly all of the remaining land (approximately 1,400 acres) and buildings are preserved and administered by the Key Partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tags":[],"id":"12107"},{"name":"Sagamore Hill National Historic Site","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"eventbrite","service_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/sagamore-hill-national-historic-site-15639725056","account":"sagamore-hill-national-historic-site-15639725056","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"12108"},{"name":"Paterson Great Falls","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/Paterson_Falls?lang=en","account":"paterson_falls","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The story of Paterson is defined by its mighty falls & chronicles America's industrial past, inventive spirit, labor innovation and movement.","long_description":"Welcome to the Paterson National Historical Park Twitter Page.

Given the fact that many Instagram users tend to be younger than those on Facebook, maintaining our Instagram account helps to ensure that our social media content reaches as diverse an audience as possible.","tags":[],"id":"12135"},{"name":"WomensRightsNPS","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"https://www.instagram.com/womensrightsnps/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Women's Rights NHP celebrates and commemorates the first Women's Rights Convention in 1848.","long_description":"Women's Rights NHP celebrates and commemorates the first Women's Rights Convention in 1848.","tags":[],"id":"12136"},{"name":"Women's Rights National Historical Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"youtube","service_url":"http://www.youtube.com/WORINHP","account":"worinhp","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"This is the official YouTube account of the Women's Rights National Historical Park, Seneca Falls ","long_description":"This is the official YouTube account of the Women's Rights National Historical Park, Seneca Falls ","tags":[],"id":"12137"},{"name":"Pinnacles National Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pinnaclesnps/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Facebook page for Pinnacles National Park","long_description":"Official Facebook page for Pinnacles National Park","tags":[],"id":"12138"},{"name":"Pinnacles National Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/PinnaclesNPS","account":"pinnaclesnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Twitter account of Pinnacles National Park","long_description":"Official Twitter account of Pinnacles National Park","tags":[],"id":"12139"},{"name":"Pinnacles National Park","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"instagram","service_url":"https://www.instagram.com/pinnaclesnps","account":"pinnaclesnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Instagram account for Pinnacles National Park","long_description":"Official Instagram account for Pinnacles National Park","tags":[],"id":"12140"},{"name":"Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://business.facebook.com/PuukoholaHeiauNHS/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Hill Of The Whale","long_description":"Constructed and completed in 1791 by Kamehameha I and the people of Hawai'i, this Heiau (temple), played a crucial role in the ruler's ascendancy.

He worked tirelessly throughout his life to remedy this problem becoming nationally recognized as –the Father of Black History.” Woodson exposed the American public and education system to the lives and history of Americans of African descent and their profound impact on American society through such endeavors as founding Negro History Week in 1926, and establishing ASALH and the Associated Publishers.","tags":[],"id":"12198"},{"name":"Frederick Douglass NPS","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/FredDouglassNPS","account":"freddouglassnps","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"This is the official Twitter page of the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.","long_description":"The Frederick Douglass National Historic Site preserves and interprets Cedar Hill, where Frederick Douglass lived from 1877 until his death in 1895.

The Historic site consists of three reconstructed North West Company buildings on their original locations and an Ojibwe Village exhibit. The Historic site is open seasonally from Memorial Day in May to Indigenous Peoples' Day in October.\r\n\r\nThe Heritage Center offers interactive exhibits, educational videos, artifacts, and a gift shop.

Explore caves created by the sudden cooling of lava flows, or visit the site of the only Indian war in California at the historic Captain Jackкs Stronghold. The Stronghold, a natural lava fortress, is where a small band of 53 warriors and their families led by Captain Jack held off a force 20 times its size for five months. Just south of the Lava Beds is Medicine Lake кs volcano, one of the largest shield volcanoes in the world. In actual mass, this volcano is larger than Mt. Shasta .

AlzPED is designed as a web-based portal for housing, sharing and mining of preclinical efficacy data. The data are submitted to AlzPED through a curator and gleaned from at least two sources; 1) the scientific literature; 2) directly from researchers.  AlzPED houses information on preclinical studies including animal models descriptors, key elements of the study design, information related to the therapeutic target and therapeutic agent, principal findings and information related to funding source(s) and financial conflict of interest.  The long term goal for AlzPED is to also serve as a platform for reporting unpublished studies in order to mitigate the publication bias that favors the reporting of positive findings.

Booth's decision to pull the trigger altered the nation's power to reconstruct after the war.

It was there that President Lincoln died early the next morning, and became the first American president to be assassinated.\r\n\r\nExplore Ford's Theatre National Historic Site and discover some of the motivations behind this tragic act and its impact on a nation trying to heal.

The original Court of Indian Offenses was created to provide law enforcement for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache (KCA) reservation.  Several prominent tribal leaders served as judges of the court including Quanah Parker (Comanche), Lone Wolf (Kiowa) and several others.  An Indian police force provided the law enforcement for the KCA, Cheyenne-Arapaho, and other reservations.  Thus, the Court of Indian Offenses pre-dates Oklahoma state courts by several decades. \r\n\r\nAfter the reservations in Oklahoma were opened by land runs to non-Indian homesteading, and federal Indian policy sought to weaken tribal governments and break up tribal land holdings, the courts over time lost their funding and consequently ceased to function.  With the void in the enforcement of tribal law, the State began to assert its authority over the remaining tribal and allotted Indian lands even though no jurisdiction properly existed.  In recent decades, the Indian tribes have regained the jurisdiction over these lands and have re-established tribal court systems.\r\nThe State of Oklahoma once contended that tribal governments had no authority to operate their own justice systems, arguing that the Indian nations had no land remaining under their jurisdictions.  Much confusion arose because many thought that tribes only asserted jurisdiction over “reservation” lands.  Many people in Oklahoma incorrectly assumed that reservations were terminated at statehood.  Recent court decisions have made it clear that tribes assert jurisdiction over all lands that are “Indian country”, including reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments.  These Indian country lands from the basis of tribal jurisdiction today.  Since few Indian tribes had operating judicial systems in place in the late 1970s. When tribal jurisdiction was re-affirmed, the Court of Indian Offenses for the Anadarko Area Tribes was created.  Courts of Indian Offenses are established throughout the U.S. Under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), providing the commonly used name — the “CFR” Court.  Until such time as a particular Indian tribe establishes their own tribal court, the Court of Indian Offenses will act as a tribe’s judicial system.  \r\n\r\nWhen the court was re-established in western Oklahoma in 1979, there were four CFR Courts covering eighteen Indian nations.  A number of tribes have since established their own systems of justice.  Accordingly, the CFR Courts for these tribes have been deactivated.  In 1991, a separate CFR Court system was established for Eastern Oklahoma Region Tribes covering eastern Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The BIA has changed dramatically over the past 185 years, evolving as Federal policies designed to subjugate and assimilate American Indians and Alaska Natives have changed to policies that promote Indian self-determination.\r\n\r\nFor almost 200 years, dating back to the role it played in negotiating treaty agreements between the United States and tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the BIA has embodied the trust and government-to-government relationships between the U.S. and the Federally recognized tribes. Over the years, the BIA has been involved in the implementation of Federal laws that have directly affected all Americans. The General Allotment Act of 1887 opened tribal lands west of the Mississippi to non-Indian settlers, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted American Indians and Alaska Natives U.S. citizenship and the right to vote, and the New Deal and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 established modern tribal governments. The World War II period of relocation and the post-War termination era of the 1950s led to the activism of the 1960s and 1970s that saw the takeover of the BIA’s headquarters and resulted in the creation of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 along with the Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act have fundamentally changed how the Federal Government and the tribes conduct business with each other.","tags":[],"id":"12968"},{"name":"USIAJobs","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/USIAJobs","account":"usiajobs","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official feed to announce job advertisements for Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Educations.","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"12969"},{"name":"USIndianAffairs","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"https://twitter.com/USIndianAffairs","account":"usindianaffairs","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Official Twitter account for the Office of the Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs shares info about BIA & BIE.","long_description":"","tags":[],"id":"12970"},{"name":"Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge","agencies":[],"contacts":[{"email":"michael_dagostino@fws.gov"}],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KilaueaPointNWR/","account":"","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The Kīlauea Point National Wildlife Refuge was established to preserve and enhance seabird nesting colonies and is home to some of the largest populations of nesting seabirds in the main Hawaiian Islands.

Education\r\nThe goal of the Teacher Empowerment for Student Success (TESS) Project is for Thai students to have the communication skills in English necessary to improve their personal, academic, and professional development. The project works in rural and under-served schools and communities in all regions of the country. Volunteers support improved English teaching through a co-teaching model, working closely with Thai teachers to plan and teach daily English lessons as well as foster a student-centered environment. In addition to working at school, Volunteers also engage with their local communities to engage them in the students’ education and organize other community development projects.\r\n\r\n2.)Youth in Development\r\nThe overall goal of the Youth in Development Project is to help Thai youth develop the skills and attributes that prepare them to be healthy engaged citizens who contribute positively to their communities. Volunteers work in the rural regions of Thailand in partnership with local government offices, schools, and health centers. Volunteers engage in community needs assessment and develop projects around two key goals- cultivating life skills and leadership and promoting healthy lifestyles. Volunteers reach youth through a combination of classes, clubs, community projects and youth camps that engage local teachers and officials as co-facilitators but also engage the youth themselves to be leaders.","tags":[],"id":"13488"},{"name":"USAID Iraq","agencies":[{"id":2148,"name":"United States Agency for International Development","url":"https://www.usaid.gov/","abbreviation":"USAID","domain":"usaid.gov","logo":{"url":null,"thumb":{"url":null},"card":{"url":null},"tag":{"url":null},"logo_square":{"url":null}},"digital_analytics_path":"","mission_statement":"We work to build a freer, more equitable and more humane world by amplifying local voices, advancing sustainable progress, and tackling the world's toughest problems.

The agency also advises the Secretary of Commerce and the President of the United States on intellectual property (IP) policy. The USPTO develops and implements education and outreach programs dedicated to promoting awareness of IP, including awareness of the creation of IP as well as the enforcement of IP rights at all‐levels. The Office of Education (OE), which resides within the Office of the Chief Communications Officer of the USPTO, has a mission to increase IP awareness and knowledge through education, outreach, and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) play a significant role in the USPTO’s K‐20 education and outreach programming because STEM is vital to invention, innovation, and the development of a future USPTO workforce. Integration of STEM knowledge, especially as it relates to IP, is also vital to the development of a future stakeholder base for the USPTO, i.e., inventors, innovators, and creators who will file better and higher quality patent and trademark applications based on their attained knowledge of IP. The programs are unique and designed to strategically reach a broad cross section of the population including, women and under‐represented and traditionally underserved groups.","tags":[],"id":"13557"},{"name":"Office of NIH History","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/nihhistory","account":"nihhistory","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The history of the National Institutes of Health.","long_description":"The Office of NIH History and Stetten Museum tells the stories of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health.","tags":[],"id":"13558"},{"name":"Office of NIH History","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"twitter","service_url":"http://twitter.com/historyatnih","account":"historyatnih","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The history of the National Institutes of Health.","long_description":"The Office of NIH History and Stetten Museum tells the stories of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health.","tags":[],"id":"13559"},{"name":"Office of NIH History","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"flickr","service_url":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/historyatnih/","account":"historyatnih","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"The history of the National Institutes of Health.","long_description":"The Office of NIH History and Stetten Museum tells the stories of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health.","tags":[],"id":"13560"},{"name":"Data Tour Notebooks","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"github","service_url":"https://github.com/NCEI-NOAAGov/data-tour-notebooks","account":"ncei-noaagov","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Data Tour Notebooks are Jupyter notebooks created to provide Python-based guided tutorials for accessing and using NOAA data from NCEI servers","long_description":"Data Tour Notebooks are Jupyter notebooks created to provide Python-based guided tutorials for accessing and using NOAA data from NCEI servers.

","long_description":"Voice of America is an international news network that is part of the U.S. government, broadcasting in 47 languages to audiences around the world. Plus One Story is the official Instagram account dedicated to inspire new conversations by connecting young Chinese-speaking people to America. Our stories aim to explore many different aspects of American life: customs, institutions, and people. \r\n\r\nPlus One Vision:\r\nA Window into everything America and how it relates to and (empowers) the Chinese. To inspire new conversations by connecting young Chinese-speaking people to America. Our stories aim to explore many different aspects of American life: customs, institutions, and people. \r\n\r\nGoal:\r\nTo engage Mandarin-speaking viewers between the age of 15-34 with high quality content and experiences. To grow subscribers on all platforms as we’re constantly brainstorming on social media strategies and content ideas to ensure growth. \r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nChinese views of the United States are changing—and changing fast. As one headline in the New York Times put it last year: “To many Chinese, America was like ‘heaven.’ Now they’re not so sure.” Increasingly, the Chinese see America as a strategic rival that has, at least according to government propaganda, been trying to keep them down. \r\n\r\nAs the same Times article concedes, affection for America still runs deep. Many continue to draw inspiration from the idea of the American dream. That’s especially true among Gen Z and Millennial Chinese.  Sixty percent of those between the ages of 15 and 34 have a favorable view of the U.S., and they’re almost 40% more likely to be interested in U.S. news. And to reach that audience, Voice of America has launched a new, digital video brand aimed at telling America’s story and how it relates to them: +1, or Jia Yi in Mandarin—because it’s the first thing you have to dial to call America from anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nWe are younger Mandarin speakers’ window into American life, culture, and current events. We aim to create content they want to see and will be on platforms they’re already on. We’re data-driven. And we’ll be nimble and quick. We are built from the ground up for this audience, by this audience.\r\n\r\nThe potential is huge and our mission is vital: There are some 133 million Chinese worldwide between the ages of 15 and 34 with access to the internet beyond China’s great firewall. And while VOA’s current Mandarin service already reaches some 60 million people, their viewers are older and more established. We need to reach the next generation, who will soon be growing up to take their place. The audience Plus One is after is the next generation of influencers, decision makers, and thought leaders. To reach them, our content runs the gamut from the serious and important (“Explaining the First Amendment\") to the fun and informal (“What is a Gender Reveal Party and Why is it Popular in America?”)\r\n\r\nWith Chinese state-sponsored misinformation on the rise, VOA’s mandate to provide comprehensive coverage and telling our audience the truth has never been more important. This audience—the future decision-makers and thought leaders of China—wants to know the truth about America. They want to know about our country and culture and how it relates to them. Plus One will be their source.","tags":[],"id":"13950"},{"name":"KCNSC YouTube Channel","agencies":[],"contacts":[],"service":"youtube","service_url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXlyCeUQisL-vF8dXjjFaQ","account":"channel","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"YouTube Channel for the Kansas City National Security Campus","long_description":"This YouTube channel compiles videos intended for an external audience, highlighting employees, technology, and everything we do at the KCNSC.","tags":[],"id":"13951"},{"name":"VOA Current Affairs","agencies":[],"contacts":[{"email":"mcoimbra@usagm.gov"}],"service":"facebook","service_url":"https://www.facebook.com/voacurrentaffairs","account":"voacurrentaffairs","language":"English","status":"published","short_description":"Voice of America is an international news network that is part of the U.S. government, broadcasting in 47 languages to audiences around the world.

First, it establishes the policies of National Science Foundation (NSF) within the framework of applicable national policies set forth by the President and the Congress. In this capacity, the Board identifies issues that are critical to NSF's future, approves NSF's strategic budget directions and the annual budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget, and approves new major programs and awards. The second role of the Board is to serve as an independent body of advisors to both the President and the Congress on policy matters related to science and engineering and education in science and engineering. In addition to major reports, the NSB also publishes occasional policy papers or statements on issues of importance to U.S. science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe NSB is made up of 25 Members appointed by the President. The NSF Director is an ex officio Member. Members serve six-year terms. With the exception of the NSF Director, one-third of the Board is appointed every two years. NSB Members are drawn from industry and universities, and represent a variety of science and engineering disciplines and geographic areas. The NSB is apolitical. The NSF Act of 1950, as amended, states that nominees to the \"Board (1) shall be eminent in the fields of the basic, medical, or social sciences, engineering, agriculture, education, research management or public affairs; (2) shall be selected solely on the basis of established records of distinguished service; and (3) shall be so selected as to provide representation of the views of scientific and engineering leaders in all areas of the Nation.\"​ The NSB elects its own Chairman and Vice Chairman. The Chairman, in turn, is authorized to make appointments to the NSB staff.
