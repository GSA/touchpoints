		"description" : "With the Release Mako Android app you can now report your live releases of shortfin mako sharks from Android mobile devices while still on the water.<\/p><p>The app uses a device’s built-in GPS, when available, to fill in exact location coordinates on the shortfin mako live release data form. The catch and release reports submitted via email allow fishermen to put their mako on the Shortfin Mako Shark Live Release Interactive Web Map at http:\/\/www.nmfs.noaa.gov\/sfa\/hms\/shortfinmako\/Map\/index.htm.<\/p><p>The submission form is easy to fill out and operates like the online submission form. Touching the latitude and longitude boxes provides an location when GPS is available. The app also includes information about shortfin mako stock status, fishing regulations, FAQs, and safe handling and release guidelines.<\/p><p>By submitting this live release information through the app, and putting their mako on the map, fishermen will be able to see how they are making a difference in the conservation of shortfin mako sharks and encourage others to do the same.<\/p><p>Overfishing is occurring on the North Atlanitc shortfin mako shark population. By releasing shortfin mako sharks that are unintentionally caught or caught for sport, U.S. fishermen will be leaders in encouraging fishermen from other nations to conserve this shark species. Get the Release Mako app and become a leader.<\/p><p>Learn more about Atlantic Shortfin Mako Sharks at http:\/\/www.nmfs.noaa.gov\/sfa\/hms\/shortfinmako\/index.htm<\/p><\/div>",

		"description" : "<p>“Satellite Insight” was created for the GOES-R mission (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, R series), under development at Goddard Space Flight Center as a joint NASA and NOAA effort. Educational as well as entertaining, the game challenges players to keep up with the stream of data from GOES-R’s six main instruments.<\/p><p>Colored blocks falling into columns on a grid represent small pieces of data. To save lives and protect expensive instruments, the GOES-R weather satellite must not lose any data. Users bundle like data types together by tapping to select three or more contiguous same-colored blocks, then tap on the GOES-R satellite to store the data before the grid overflows. Data blocks fall slowly at first, but arrive faster as the game continues. Each speed-up also brings a power-up tool players can use at any time to help clear the grid. They keep the game going as long as they can and try to beat their best time.<\/p><p>The game builds awareness of this important technical resource that most people never hear about. The game instructions also include basic information about GOES-R and geostationary orbits, as well as links to The Space Place, the NASA Science Mission Directorate’s website for elementary school kids; and SciJinks, the website about weather and Earth science for middle-school kids jointly sponsored by NASA and NOAA.<\/p>",

Vantage Point presents highlights from this young but growing collection, with pieces by 25 artists working across a range of media from paintings, drawings, and photography to video projection and mixed-media installation. These complex and richly layered works speak to the concerns and experiences of Native people today and are organized around the following four themes: personal memory and identity, history and the contemporary urban experience, landscape and place, and cultural memory and persistence. The artists featured include James Lavadour (Walla Walla), Truman Lowe (Ho-Chunk), Alan Michelson (Mohawk), and Marie Watt (Seneca), Kent Monkman (Cree), and Emmi Whitehorse (Navajo).<\/p>",

		"description" : "IveGot1 brings the power of EDDMapS to your iPhone. Now you can submit invasive species observations directly with your iPhone from the field. These reports are uploaded to EDDMapS and e-mailed directly to local and state verifiers for review. IveGot1 was developed by the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health through a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. IveGot1 is more than just an iPhone app, it is an integrated invasive species reporting and outreach campaign for Florida that includes the app, a website with direct access to invasive species reporting and a hotline 1-888-IVEGOT1 for instant reports of live animals. <\/p><p>Every year more than 85 million people visit Florida. However, people are not Florida's only visitors; Florida is also an inviting destination for invasive species that threaten to undermine the health of our environment. More than an inconvenience, invasive plants and animals can greatly alter our native landscape, adversely impact native wildlife, destroy agricultural crops and threaten our health. Invasions of exotic species cost Floridians over $500 million each year. The economic costs are small compared to the ecological ones. Florida has millions of acres of public lands; these lands furnish us the water we drink, the air we breathe and countless recreational opportunities. These public lands are highly vulnerable to invasion by exotic plant and animal species; it is estimated that more than 1.7 million acres of Florida’s natural areas have been infested by invasive species. <\/p><p>By reporting sightings of invasive animals and plants, we can better assess the extent of the infestations and hopefully eradicate new infestations before they become huge problems such as melaleuca or Burmese pythons. The goal of IveGot1 is to make identification and reporting easy and efficient as possible. Easy species reporting that captures your current location and allows you to submit an image of your sightings. <\/p><p>Features: <\/p><ul><li>IveGot1 allows for both online and offline reporting with reports saved on your phone for uploading when you have network connectivity. Images and information on Florida's worst non-native invasive animals and plants. Real-time point distribution maps centered on your current location. Get Involved - Join the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council or your local Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area (CISMA) through the Florida Invasive Species Partnership. Powered by EDDMapS - The University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health's Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System. EDDMapS allows for real time tracking of invasive species occurrences using local and national distribution maps and electronic early detection reporting tools.",

That website was derived from a CD format system of the same name, published in 2002, which in turn was developed from English (1994) and Spanish (1998) books of the same title.<\/p><p>This App provides a set of portable identification tools functionally equivalent to those in the website edition. While that website requires an ongoing internet connection to function, the App works independently of the web after being downloaded. Fishes: East Pacific works wherever an iPhone can go. As well as acting as an ID Guide this App also allows users to make and organize lists that record information about fishes in the App’s database, and can be downloaded by email.<\/p><p>- Language Interfaces<br \/>This App includes complete English and Spanish language interfaces. The user is automatically connected to the interface that relates to the language set in the preferences of the device.<\/p><p>- Authors<br \/>D Ross Robertson , Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Republic of Panamá<br \/>Gerald R Allen , the Western Australian Museum, Perth, Western Australia.<br \/>Contact: drr@stri.org<\/p><\/div>",

		"description" : "<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) closely monitors the flight processing times, commonly referred to as wait times, for arriving flights at 23 of the busiest international airports. The flight processing time is the length of time from flight arrival to the time the last passenger on the flight is screened by CBP officers in the primary processing area. Flight arrival patterns can vary considerably by time of year and day of week, as well as by time of day. The best predictor of wait times for future flights is the wait time observed for the corresponding seasonal time period in the recent past. To help travelers in planning their next flight, CBP is providing the public with historical data for the past twelve months that can be used to estimate seasonal wait times by airport and arrival terminal. As you are planning your next flight, remember that CBP airport wait times do not include time to retrieve baggage or navigate through the airport. These times should be factored in as well if you will be scheduling a connecting flight. Always consult with the airline and airport authority for additional guidance.<\/p>",

The book contains over 140 classic fables, accompanied by beautiful illustrations and interactive animations.<br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/><br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/>“Aesop's Fables”—also called “the Aesopica”—are a collection of stories designed to teach moral lessons credited to Aesop, a Greek slave and story-teller thought to have lived between 620 and 560 BCE.<br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/><br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/>Aesop's fables are some of the most well known in the world and have been translated in multiple languages and become popular in dozens of cultures through the course of five centuries. They have been told and retold in a variety of media, from oral tradition to written storybooks to stage, film and animated cartoon versions—even in architecture.<br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/><br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/>The fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Younger scholars will be able to trace the origin of aphorisms such as “sour grapes” and “a bird in the hand.”<br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/><br style=\" widows: 2; orphans: 2; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" \/>This interactive ebook is presented by the Library of Congress, adapted from the book “The Aesop for Children: with Pictures by Milo Winter,” published by Rand, McNally &amp; Co in 1919.

This map-based app allows users to search FMRs and income limits by current location or by metropolitan area, county, zipcode and\/or address. Download this app now to determine payment amounts and rent thresholds for HUD’s housing assistance programs, and discover the income limits established by HUD for households of different sizes in each location to determine eligibility for a variety of programs.<\/p>",

This information allows vessel operators to avoid collision with right whales by slowing down and heightening their visual awareness. Whale Alert can help reduce the likelihood of ships colliding with these endangered whales, which can injure or kill them.\r\n\r\nThe Whale Alert App is designed to complement existing protective measures by providing mariners and others with all relevant right whale conservation and management measures in a single location displayed on NOAA nautical charts. \r\n\r\nFor more information, including a start-up manual and video tutorial go to http:\/\/stellwagen.noaa.gov\/ and click on Whale Alert.\r\n\r\nWhale Alert features include:\r\n\r\n• NOAA Atlantic Seasonal Management Areas\r\n• NOAA Atlantic Dynamic Management Areas\r\n• NOAA Atlantic MSR Boundaries\r\n• NOAA Atlantic Recommended Routes\r\n• NOAA and IMO Atlantic designated Areas-to-be-Avoided\r\n• Near Real-time Boston-area Acoustic Whale Detection Buoys\r\n• Receipt of Acoustic Buoy detections and Dynamic Management Areas via Internet or\r\nAIS over WIFI\r\n• Seamless Nautical Chart of the Atlantic Coast\r\n• GPS Position Tracking and Alert for Entering Management Areas\r\n\r\nWhale Alert does not provide individual sighting location of whales.\r\n\r\nWhale Alert has been developed by a collaboration of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit conservation groups and private sector industries, led by scientists at NOAA’s Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.

		"description" : "Dried botanicals are imported for varied uses including potpourri, decorative plant arrangements, and handicraft items. In the twenty-first century market, dried botanicals consist of whole or sectioned fungi, fruits, seeds, leaves, and almost anything that is botanical, has abundant air spaces (\"physical fixatives\" for the synthetic oils), has structural interest, and\/or is inexpensive (e.g. lawn sweepings and waste products of other industries). While chiefly imported, materials are occasionally from North American sources. These botanicals may include potentially toxic species (e.g. strychnine leaves and fruits) as well as potential invasives (e.g., she-oak, an invasive in Florida). The latter can be a problem when buyers throw old potpourri in the garden. Some (e.g. members of the Rutaceae) may carry plant diseases.\r\n\r\nBecause these botanical materials are often not only sectioned but also bleached and\/or dyed and then scented with fragrance oils, a botanical key to the whole plant, or even plant parts, is not practical. Thus, in this unique identification key, features such as shape, size, and texture are used. The key relies heavily upon the use of images and is structured so that both the professional botanist, who knows the difference between the Agaricales and Polyporales, and the amateur, who may not be able to distinguish sections of a bracket fungus from pieces of stem pith, can achieve an identification for a specimen. Because of the diversity of plants and plant parts and the accompanying esoteric vocabulary, practical terms (e.g. \"football-shaped\") have been used in the key. However, to maximize their value and validity, the fact sheets utilize botanical terminology.\r\n\r\nKey authors: Arthur O. Tucker, Amanda J. Redford, and Julia Scher\r\n\r\nThis key is part of a complete Dried Botanical ID tool: http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/dried_botanical\/\r\n\r\nLucid Mobile key developed by USDA APHIS ITP",

		"description" : "Dried botanicals are imported for varied uses including potpourri, decorative plant arrangements, and handicraft items. In the twenty-first century market, dried botanicals consist of whole or sectioned fungi, fruits, seeds, leaves, and almost anything that is botanical, has abundant air spaces (\"physical fixatives\" for the synthetic oils), has structural interest, and\/or is inexpensive (e.g. lawn sweepings and waste products of other industries). While chiefly imported, materials are occasionally from North American sources. These botanicals may include potentially toxic species (e.g. strychnine leaves and fruits) as well as potential invasives (e.g., she-oak, an invasive in Florida). The latter can be a problem when buyers throw old potpourri in the garden. Some (e.g. members of the Rutaceae) may carry plant diseases.\r\n\r\nBecause these botanical materials are often not only sectioned but also bleached and\/or dyed and then scented with fragrance oils, a botanical key to the whole plant, or even plant parts, is not practical. Thus, in this unique identification key, features such as shape, size, and texture are used. The key relies heavily upon the use of images and is structured so that both the professional botanist, who knows the difference between the Agaricales and Polyporales, and the amateur, who may not be able to distinguish sections of a bracket fungus from pieces of stem pith, can achieve an identification for a specimen. Because of the diversity of plants and plant parts and the accompanying esoteric vocabulary, practical terms (e.g. \"football-shaped\") have been used in the key. However, to maximize their value and validity, the fact sheets utilize botanical terminology.\r\n\r\nKey authors: Arthur O. Tucker, Amanda J. Redford, and Julia Scher\r\n\r\nThis key is part of a complete Dried Botanical ID tool: http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/dried_botanical\/\r\n\r\nLucid Mobile key developed by USDA APHIS ITP",

		"description" : "Officials in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have determined that certain species not native to the U.S. are at risk of becoming invasive should they enter this country. As part of its effort to prevent the introduction of invasive or potentially invasive weeds, the USDA maintains an official list of \"federal noxious weeds\" (FNW) (7 CFR 360.200 and 361.6). Many taxa on this list are currently serious weeds elsewhere in the world, and about two-thirds of the taxa are currently found in the U.S. Most of the FNW taxa are angiosperms, but a few are ferns and one is a green alga. NOTE that the ferns and alga are not included in this app.\r\n\r\nFruits and seeds are the plant disseminules most responsible for the spread of weeds to new regions. Federal Noxious Weed Disseminules of the U.S. Keys was developed to enable accurate identification of FNW angiosperm disseminules. The three keys (Grasses=Poaceae; Legumes=Fabaceae; and Other Angiosperm Plant Families) were designed to be used by officials at U.S. ports responsible for identification of plant pests. It may also be a useful resource for seed professionals and anyone else with an interest in, or a need to know about, noxious weed disseminules.\r\n\r\nThirty-one families are currently represented on the FNW list as of 2013. Most of the taxa are individual species, but two are species complexes, Rubus fruticosus L. agg. and Salvinia auriculata complex (not included in the app key since an aquatic ferm), and one is an infraspecific taxon (Setaria pumila (Poir.) Roem. & Schult. ssp. pallidefusca (Schumach) B. K. Simon). Note that fact sheets for the FNW species of six genera Aeginetia, Alectra, Cuscuta, Moraea, Orobanche, Striga have been treated together in their own \"genus-level\" fact sheets.\r\n\r\nThe three interactive family keys include only those FNW taxa that produce seed and fruit disseminules (i.e., angiosperms). Eight taxa are not included in the interactive keys either because they lack angiosperm sexual reproduction altogether or they produce seed only rarely. One group lacking fruits and seeds are the ferns, which reproduce via spores as well as by vegetative means. Reproduction via vegetative disseminules is the primary means of dispersal for some non-ferns (three angiosperms and an alga) as well. The eight taxa not in the keys are the terrestial ferns Lygodium flexuosum (L.) Sw. and Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br., the aquatic ferns Azolla pinnata R.Br. and the Salvinia auriculata complex, the aquatic angiosperms Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle and Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss, the sterile angiosperm hybrid Opuntia aurantiaca Lindl., and the alga Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) Agardh.\r\n\r\nAll photographic images were produced by the authors except where acknowledged in image captions.

The key also includes species of quarantine significance as well as invasive and contaminant mollusc species commonly intercepted at U.S. ports of entry. This key is designed for federal, state and other agencies or organizations within the U.S. that are concerned with the detection and identification of molluscs of significance. This key includes 33 families and 128 species. It should be noted that this key is not inclusive of all mollusc pests, as new species of interest arise almost daily.\r\n\r\nThe list of species included in this tool was generated based on pest species reported in scholarly publications by Barker 2002, Cowie et al. 2009, and Godan 1983 as well as commonly intercepted species documented in the port of entry interception data from US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine division (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) -Division of Plant Industry.\r\n\r\nThe key is unable to identify a few entities below the family level. This is true especially for the families Veronicellidae and Succineidae. The major reason for this is the lack of diagnostic morphological characters and the variability of members of these groups. In many cases, it is recommended that molecular techniques be used in the identification of members of these families (Holland and Cowie 2007; Gomes et al. 2010). This inadequacy of the key is, however, mitigated by the fact that most if not all members of these problematic groups are pestiferous and as such are regulated at the family level. The same is true for the species complexes (e.g., Arion hortensis group, A. ater group) included in the tool.\r\n\r\nThe Terrestrial Mollusc Key was developed and published by the Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) as part of a cooperative agreement with the Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) and is under the direction of Terrence Walters, CPHST Identification Technology Program (ITP) coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe photographs utilized in this key were generously provided by those credited on each.

The application is intended as a follow-on to CO2SYS, originally developed by Lewis and Wallace (1998) and later modified for Microsoft Excel by Denis Pierrot (Pierrot and others, 2006). While CO2calc expands on the functionality of CO2SYS, much of the code of the latter program was adopted with minimal changes to ensure back-compatibility. CO2calc offers several improvements on CO2SYS, including:\r\n•An improved graphical user interface for data entry and results\r\n•Additional calculations of air-sea CO2 fluxes (for surface water calculations)\r\n•The ability to tag data with sample name, comments, date, time, and latitude\/longitude\r\n•The ability to use the system time and date and latitude\/longitude (automatic retrieval of latitude and longitude available on iPhone 3, 3GS\r\n•An option to save and email sample information, data input, and calculated results as a comma-separated value (CSV) file for use with Microsoft Excel, ArcGIS, or other applications\r\n\r\nFor questions about the original CO2SYS, the user is referred to the CO2SYS documentation at http:\/\/cdiac.ornl.gov\/oceans\/co2rprt.html#aboutco2sys.

The National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2) is a Department of Defense organization that evaluates new technologies for telemental health. BioZen represents an approach to mobile monitoring of biosensor devices that may be further developed to support future projects. No further development or enhancements to BioZen are planned.\r\n\r\nUsing BioZen requires compatible biosensor devices (see listing below). These devices and BioZen are not designed or intended for psychological therapy or medical treatments.\r\n\r\nBioZen can display several brain wave bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) separately, as well as combinations of several bands using algorithms that may indicate relevant cognitive states, such as meditation and attention. BioZen features a meditation module that represents biometric information with user-selectable graphics that change in response to the user's biometric data.\r\n\r\nBiofeedback data is recorded in real time, so users can observe relationships between recorded biophysiological data and their behavior. Users' can create notes to document and categorize their recording session. BioZen automatically generates graphical feedback from the recording sessions to allow users' to monitor their progress over time.",

It is intended to serve as a source of readily available support and information for adults who are already in treatment to quit smoking - - to help them stay quit even after treatment ends. The app guides users in creating a tailored plan that takes into account their personal reasons for quitting. It provides information about smoking and quitting, interactive tools to help users cope with urges to smoke, and motivational messages and support contacts to help users stay smoke-free.\r\n\r\nStay Quit Coach is based on the smoking treatment manual “Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation: Treatment for Veterans with PTSD,” which was written by Miles McFall and Andrew Saxon in collaboration with David Kalman and Timothy Carmody. This treatment is based on evidence-based clinical practices, and has been shown to double quit rates of military veterans with PTSD. Stay Quit Coach was the result of a collaborative effort among the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD), the VA Sierra Pacific (VISN 21) Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Clinical Public Health Group (CPH) and the Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2).

Data and research in this app are taken from USDOL’s three flagship reports: Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor; and List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor. This app fits these three information-packed reports the size of a phone book in the palm of your hand. With this app you can:\r\n\r\n• Check countries’ efforts to eliminate child labor\r\n• Find child labor data\r\n• Browse goods produced with child labor or forced labor\r\n• Review laws and ratifications\r\n• See what governments can to do end child labor\r\n\r\nUsing this app can be a starting point to empower yourself with knowledge about child labor or forced labor around the world. Anyone with an interest in these issues – governments, businesses, academics, civil society, consumers – can use it as a source of information to begin asking questions, taking action, and demanding change.",

The S.O.S. app provides step-by-step video narration by Dr. Oz and follow along demonstrations allowing people to quickly and confidently respond to common emergency situations with the goal of saving lives. This free app also includes an expansive Resource Guide for easy access to additional emergency care information.<\/p><p>Emergency care protocols for over 30 of the most common emergency care situations were developed and reviewed by prestigious medical and educational panels from both the American Red Cross and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). These protocols were then adapted for an Android app environment and are accompanied by dynamic videos that walk through clear and concise emergency action steps that are appropriate for any audience. Dr. Oz is the instructional voice of each video, reassuringly guiding users on how to provide emergency care. 3-D animations are included for the more complex techniques, specifically Unconscious Choking and CPR which also include an audio and visual counter for real time CPR compressions.<\/p><p>The Resource Guide covers over 50 common emergency care situations and was adapted from current American Red Cross training materials. It includes information on everything from CPR to seizures to broken bones, all in an easy to understand and browse Q&amp;A format.<\/p><p>In addition to the emergency protocols and resource guide, the SOS app features 911 dialing that auto launches a helpful map with location information which becomes active while on call with emergency dispatch. Additionally, the SOS app provides the same helpful information for 911 calls manually dialed from outside the app. SOS app users can quickly access rich resource materials with voice recognition and keep personal emergency contact info handy at all times.<\/p>",

During a trip, no internet connection is required and all data is stored locally. Locally stored trips can be edited until synced to the Conserve.IO cloud server - which provides user and organizational level access to collected data as well as data export. \r\n\r\nSurveys and forms are based on organization project profiles and are delivered directly to the app based on a user's group membership - allowing one app to serve a wide variety of efforts. New groups and surveys can be developed quickly and deployed without requiring any app updates by the end user. \r\n\r\n►► IMPORTANT - IPOD TOUCH AND WIFI-ONLY IPADS - This application will not be fully functional on these devices, unless you have an external GPS attachment. The GPS recorder and compass will be inactive.\r\n\r\n►► GPS WARNING - Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",
