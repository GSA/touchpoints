The app also includes information about shortfin mako stock status, fishing regulations, FAQs, and safe handling and release guidelines.<\/p><p>By submitting this live release information through the app, and putting their mako on the map, fishermen will be able to see how they are making a difference in the conservation of shortfin mako sharks and encourage others to do the same.<\/p><p>Overfishing is occurring on the North Atlanitc shortfin mako shark population. By releasing shortfin mako sharks that are unintentionally caught or caught for sport, U.S. fishermen will be leaders in encouraging fishermen from other nations to conserve this shark species. Get the Release Mako app and become a leader.<\/p><p>Learn more about Atlantic Shortfin Mako Sharks at http:\/\/www.nmfs.noaa.gov\/sfa\/hms\/shortfinmako\/index.htm<\/p><\/div>",

The S.O.S. app provides step-by-step video narration by Dr. Oz and follow along demonstrations allowing people to quickly and confidently respond to common emergency situations with the goal of saving lives. This free app also includes an expansive Resource Guide for easy access to additional emergency care information.<\/p><p>Emergency care protocols for over 30 of the most common emergency care situations were developed and reviewed by prestigious medical and educational panels from both the American Red Cross and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). These protocols were then adapted for an Android app environment and are accompanied by dynamic videos that walk through clear and concise emergency action steps that are appropriate for any audience. Dr. Oz is the instructional voice of each video, reassuringly guiding users on how to provide emergency care. 3-D animations are included for the more complex techniques, specifically Unconscious Choking and CPR which also include an audio and visual counter for real time CPR compressions.<\/p><p>The Resource Guide covers over 50 common emergency care situations and was adapted from current American Red Cross training materials. It includes information on everything from CPR to seizures to broken bones, all in an easy to understand and browse Q&amp;A format.<\/p><p>In addition to the emergency protocols and resource guide, the SOS app features 911 dialing that auto launches a helpful map with location information which becomes active while on call with emergency dispatch. Additionally, the SOS app provides the same helpful information for 911 calls manually dialed from outside the app. SOS app users can quickly access rich resource materials with voice recognition and keep personal emergency contact info handy at all times.<\/p>",

Educational as well as entertaining, the game challenges players to keep up with the stream of data from GOES-R’s six main instruments.<\/p><p>Colored blocks falling into columns on a grid represent small pieces of data. To save lives and protect expensive instruments, the GOES-R weather satellite must not lose any data. Users bundle like data types together by tapping to select three or more contiguous same-colored blocks, then tap on the GOES-R satellite to store the data before the grid overflows. Data blocks fall slowly at first, but arrive faster as the game continues. Each speed-up also brings a power-up tool players can use at any time to help clear the grid. They keep the game going as long as they can and try to beat their best time.<\/p><p>The game builds awareness of this important technical resource that most people never hear about. The game instructions also include basic information about GOES-R and geostationary orbits, as well as links to The Space Place, the NASA Science Mission Directorate’s website for elementary school kids; and SciJinks, the website about weather and Earth science for middle-school kids jointly sponsored by NASA and NOAA.<\/p>",

These reports are uploaded to EDDMapS and e-mailed directly to local and state verifiers for review. IveGot1 was developed by the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health through a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. IveGot1 is more than just an iPhone app, it is an integrated invasive species reporting and outreach campaign for Florida that includes the app, a website with direct access to invasive species reporting and a hotline 1-888-IVEGOT1 for instant reports of live animals. <\/p><p>Every year more than 85 million people visit Florida. However, people are not Florida's only visitors; Florida is also an inviting destination for invasive species that threaten to undermine the health of our environment. More than an inconvenience, invasive plants and animals can greatly alter our native landscape, adversely impact native wildlife, destroy agricultural crops and threaten our health. Invasions of exotic species cost Floridians over $500 million each year. The economic costs are small compared to the ecological ones. Florida has millions of acres of public lands; these lands furnish us the water we drink, the air we breathe and countless recreational opportunities. These public lands are highly vulnerable to invasion by exotic plant and animal species; it is estimated that more than 1.7 million acres of Florida’s natural areas have been infested by invasive species. <\/p><p>By reporting sightings of invasive animals and plants, we can better assess the extent of the infestations and hopefully eradicate new infestations before they become huge problems such as melaleuca or Burmese pythons. The goal of IveGot1 is to make identification and reporting easy and efficient as possible. Easy species reporting that captures your current location and allows you to submit an image of your sightings. <\/p><p>Features: <\/p><ul><li>IveGot1 allows for both online and offline reporting with reports saved on your phone for uploading when you have network connectivity. Images and information on Florida's worst non-native invasive animals and plants. Real-time point distribution maps centered on your current location. Get Involved - Join the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council or your local Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area (CISMA) through the Florida Invasive Species Partnership. Powered by EDDMapS - The University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health's Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System. EDDMapS allows for real time tracking of invasive species occurrences using local and national distribution maps and electronic early detection reporting tools.",

The flight processing time is the length of time from flight arrival to the time the last passenger on the flight is screened by CBP officers in the primary processing area. Flight arrival patterns can vary considerably by time of year and day of week, as well as by time of day. The best predictor of wait times for future flights is the wait time observed for the corresponding seasonal time period in the recent past. To help travelers in planning their next flight, CBP is providing the public with historical data for the past twelve months that can be used to estimate seasonal wait times by airport and arrival terminal. As you are planning your next flight, remember that CBP airport wait times do not include time to retrieve baggage or navigate through the airport. These times should be factored in as well if you will be scheduling a connecting flight. Always consult with the airline and airport authority for additional guidance.<\/p>",

Additionally, many citrus varieties are backyard crop plants, providing important sources of food at a local community level. As a result, citrus is one of the most economically important groups of plants. Numerous insect pests threaten the citrus industry and backyard citrus trees through feeding damage, while other pests vector diseases that are potentially lethal.\r\n\r\nCitrus Pests Key is aimed primarily at extension agents, inspectors, and other plant professionals with access to a light microscope and hand lens. It is designed to help users determine which type of citrus insect pest they have encountered by featuring an interactive key coupled with illustrated, descriptive fact sheets for each pest. Citrus Pests Key is intended to be used as a screening aid. For definitive species identification, specimens should be sent to an expert for verification.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial development of the key, an advisory committee developed a comprehensive list of over 300 pest and beneficial arthropods that needed to be considered for inclusion into the key. Since the key was designed and scoped as a basic screening aid to support survey and detection support, 51 total species from the comprehensive list were selected by the authors based on the following criteria:\r\n- commonly found insect pests on cultivated citrus in the U.S. as determined by the Citrus Pest Advisory Committee,\r\n- citrus insect pests that have been intercepted at U.S. ports but have not become established,\r\n- insect pests that have entered the U.S. but have now been eradicated, and\r\n- exotic insect pests of immediate concern to U.S. cultivated citrus.\r\n\r\nKey authors: Sarahlynne Guerrero, Jennifer Weeks, Amanda Hodges, Kirk Martin, and Norman Leppla\r\n\r\nThis key is part of a complete Citrus Pests tool: http:\/\/idtools.org\/id\/citrus\/pests\/",

		"long_description" : "Citrus pests and diseases may be found on a number of plant species in various plant families. The Citrus ID Key is primarily intended to help people working or conducting pest surveys in citrus orchards, variety collections, and home gardens, so its focus is limited exclusively to the citrus family (Rutaceae). Although eight genera of Rutaceae are native to the continental United States (Amyris, Choisya, Cneoridium, Esenbeckia, Helietta, Ptelea, Thamnosma, and Zanthoxylum), most of these are unlikely to be encountered in our target locations and can be keyed using regional guides. The cultivars and taxa of citrus and relatives that have been introduced and released for cultivation are the most likely to be encountered in cultivated settings, so the Citrus ID Key concentrates on these taxa.\r\n\r\nCultivars of citrus and its relatives are released in the United States through state agencies and to a lesser extent the USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Citrus & Dates. Our target list of entities was synthesized from the cultivar lists provided by the California Citrus Clonal Protection Program, the Florida Citrus Arboretum, the Florida Chiefland Budwood Distribution Center, the Florida Bureau of Citrus Budwood Registration, and the Texas Budwood Certification Program. Arizona no longer certifies budwood, instead relying on the California program. The resulting target list includes over 500 entities of citrus and relatives cultivated in the United States.\r\n\r\nField identification to the level of cultivar remains impossible in most cases. This is partially due to the complicated reticulate breeding history of citrus, but also, selection has generally focused on characters such as taste, disease and stress resistance, and fruiting phenology rather than on characters of ornamental (and thus morphological) value. This key facilitates identification to at least the cultivar group level within citrus (e.g., sweet oranges, sour oranges, etc.), if not beyond for select cultivars.\r\n\r\nOriginal illustrations and photography: Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the source for plant images included in Citrus ID Key should be cited as \"Herbarium (NCSC).\" NCSC is the official abbreviation for the North Carolina State University Herbarium.

		"long_description" : "Dried botanicals are imported for varied uses including potpourri, decorative plant arrangements, and handicraft items. In the twenty-first century market, dried botanicals consist of whole or sectioned fungi, fruits, seeds, leaves, and almost anything that is botanical, has abundant air spaces (\"physical fixatives\" for the synthetic oils), has structural interest, and\/or is inexpensive (e.g. lawn sweepings and waste products of other industries). While chiefly imported, materials are occasionally from North American sources. These botanicals may include potentially toxic species (e.g. strychnine leaves and fruits) as well as potential invasives (e.g., she-oak, an invasive in Florida). The latter can be a problem when buyers throw old potpourri in the garden. Some (e.g. members of the Rutaceae) may carry plant diseases.\r\n\r\nBecause these botanical materials are often not only sectioned but also bleached and\/or dyed and then scented with fragrance oils, a botanical key to the whole plant, or even plant parts, is not practical. Thus, in this unique identification key, features such as shape, size, and texture are used. The key relies heavily upon the use of images and is structured so that both the professional botanist, who knows the difference between the Agaricales and Polyporales, and the amateur, who may not be able to distinguish sections of a bracket fungus from pieces of stem pith, can achieve an identification for a specimen. Because of the diversity of plants and plant parts and the accompanying esoteric vocabulary, practical terms (e.g. \"football-shaped\") have been used in the key. However, to maximize their value and validity, the fact sheets utilize botanical terminology.\r\n\r\nKey authors: Arthur O. Tucker, Amanda J.

		"long_description" : "Officials in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have determined that certain species not native to the U.S. are at risk of becoming invasive should they enter this country. As part of its effort to prevent the introduction of invasive or potentially invasive weeds, the USDA maintains an official list of \"federal noxious weeds\" (FNW) (7 CFR 360.200 and 361.6). Many taxa on this list are currently serious weeds elsewhere in the world, and about two-thirds of the taxa are currently found in the U.S. Most of the FNW taxa are angiosperms, but a few are ferns and one is a green alga. NOTE that the ferns and alga are not included in this app.\r\n\r\nFruits and seeds are the plant disseminules most responsible for the spread of weeds to new regions. Federal Noxious Weed Disseminules of the U.S. Keys was developed to enable accurate identification of FNW angiosperm disseminules. The three keys (Grasses=Poaceae; Legumes=Fabaceae; and Other Angiosperm Plant Families) were designed to be used by officials at U.S. ports responsible for identification of plant pests. It may also be a useful resource for seed professionals and anyone else with an interest in, or a need to know about, noxious weed disseminules.\r\n\r\nThirty-one families are currently represented on the FNW list as of 2013. Most of the taxa are individual species, but two are species complexes, Rubus fruticosus L. agg. and Salvinia auriculata complex (not included in the app key since an aquatic ferm), and one is an infraspecific taxon (Setaria pumila (Poir.) Roem. & Schult. ssp. pallidefusca (Schumach) B. K. Simon). Note that fact sheets for the FNW species of six genera Aeginetia, Alectra, Cuscuta, Moraea, Orobanche, Striga have been treated together in their own \"genus-level\" fact sheets.\r\n\r\nThe three interactive family keys include only those FNW taxa that produce seed and fruit disseminules (i.e., angiosperms). Eight taxa are not included in the interactive keys either because they lack angiosperm sexual reproduction altogether or they produce seed only rarely. One group lacking fruits and seeds are the ferns, which reproduce via spores as well as by vegetative means. Reproduction via vegetative disseminules is the primary means of dispersal for some non-ferns (three angiosperms and an alga) as well. The eight taxa not in the keys are the terrestial ferns Lygodium flexuosum (L.) Sw. and Lygodium microphyllum (Cav.) R. Br., the aquatic ferns Azolla pinnata R.Br. and the Salvinia auriculata complex, the aquatic angiosperms Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle and Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss, the sterile angiosperm hybrid Opuntia aurantiaca Lindl., and the alga Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) Agardh.\r\n\r\nAll photographic images were produced by the authors except where acknowledged in image captions.

They are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, and many palms have been used as crop plants for centuries, providing important sources of food and a variety of other products. As such, palms are one of the most economically important groups of plants. Relative to most cultivated plants, palms are relatively pest-free. However, a number of arthropod pests attack palms in sufficient force to be a threat to the plant, and some vector diseases that are potentially lethal to palms.\r\n\r\nThe intended audience for these keys is non-experts working in the field within Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS), National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and other national, regional, and state agricultural agencies\/organizations with responsibilities associated with pest and disease survey and detection.

Since many diseases, disorders, and insect pests can cause similar symptoms, this key will often lead to more than one possible field diagnosis. Consulting the fact sheets may help to narrow down the diagnosis to a single cause. For definitive confirmation of diseases and insects, the appropriate tissue samples or insect specimens should be sent to an expert for verification.\r\n\r\nThis key is based solely on visual symptoms for two primary reasons. First, visual symptoms are sufficient to diagnose many palm problems, especially physiological disorders such as nutrient deficiencies. Second, visual symptoms are the first step in determining which diagnostic lab to use for further analysis and which tissue should be sampled for analysis. Many times, diagnosis of a palm problem is a multi-step procedure whereby possible causes of the problem are ruled out, one at a time. Never rely on a laboratory diagnosis without also making a good faith attempt at the visual diagnosis. The two diagnoses should agree. Just because a laboratory report suggests deficiencies of one or more nutrient elements or the presence of one or more potential pathogens does not mean that those deficiencies or pathogens are the actual cause of the particular problem. False positives are common, and often misleading. This is one weakness of laboratory diagnostics when used as the sole method of diagnosis. In the case of palm diseases, false negatives are also a common problem, especially when the wrong tissue is sampled or a sample of poor quality is submitted to the laboratory. If the two diagnoses (visual and lab) do not agree, then re-examine the problem to determine which diagnosis is more likely to explain the symptoms being observed (compare to descriptions and photos in the fact sheets), and if you sampled the correct material for the laboratory diagnosis. Alternatively, you may need to start at the beginning as neither diagnosis may be correct.\r\n\r\nThe intended audience for this key is non-experts working in the field within Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS), National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), and other national, regional, and state agricultural agencies\/organizations with responsibilities associated with pest and disease survey and detection.

This key is designed for federal, state and other agencies or organizations within the U.S. that are concerned with the detection and identification of molluscs of significance. This key includes 33 families and 128 species. It should be noted that this key is not inclusive of all mollusc pests, as new species of interest arise almost daily.\r\n\r\nThe list of species included in this tool was generated based on pest species reported in scholarly publications by Barker 2002, Cowie et al. 2009, and Godan 1983 as well as commonly intercepted species documented in the port of entry interception data from US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine division (USDA-APHIS-PPQ) and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) -Division of Plant Industry.\r\n\r\nThe key is unable to identify a few entities below the family level. This is true especially for the families Veronicellidae and Succineidae. The major reason for this is the lack of diagnostic morphological characters and the variability of members of these groups. In many cases, it is recommended that molecular techniques be used in the identification of members of these families (Holland and Cowie 2007; Gomes et al. 2010). This inadequacy of the key is, however, mitigated by the fact that most if not all members of these problematic groups are pestiferous and as such are regulated at the family level. The same is true for the species complexes (e.g., Arion hortensis group, A. ater group) included in the tool.\r\n\r\nThe Terrestrial Mollusc Key was developed and published by the Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) as part of a cooperative agreement with the Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) and is under the direction of Terrence Walters, CPHST Identification Technology Program (ITP) coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe photographs utilized in this key were generously provided by those credited on each.

It provides information about smoking and quitting, interactive tools to help users cope with urges to smoke, and motivational messages and support contacts to help users stay smoke-free.\r\n\r\nStay Quit Coach is based on the smoking treatment manual “Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation: Treatment for Veterans with PTSD,” which was written by Miles McFall and Andrew Saxon in collaboration with David Kalman and Timothy Carmody. This treatment is based on evidence-based clinical practices, and has been shown to double quit rates of military veterans with PTSD. Stay Quit Coach was the result of a collaborative effort among the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD), the VA Sierra Pacific (VISN 21) Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC), VA Clinical Public Health Group (CPH) and the Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2). Additional partners include the VA Puget Sound Health Care System and Northwest (VISN 20) MIRECC, and VA Mid-Atlantic (VISN 6) MIRECC.",

The hard-fought Italian Campaign, which lasted more than a year, proved a critical element to the eventual victory in Europe.

The site contains visualization tools, predictive tools, and tools that make data easier to find and use. Training courses are available online or can be brought to the user’s location. Information is also organized by topic—the top picks from the site, for instance, that relate to green infrastructure or climate adaptation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the site successful? The targeted audience—the coastal management community. Content on the site comes from many sources, but being relevant to this audience is the requirement. The Digital Coast Partnership helps ensure this relevance, as this group provides user insight and feedback.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Coast is managed by NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management and was first released in 2007. \r\n",

		"long_description" : "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe megadiverse Scarabaeoidea (scarabs, stags, and bess beetles) consists of over 31,000 species that are distributed worldwide and includes many important agricultural pests, agents of biological control of dung and dung flies, important pollinators, and species used as habitat bioindicators (Jameson and Ratcliffe, 2002; Ratcliffe, et al., 2002). Despite their ecological, evolutionary, and economic significance, there is an overwhelming lack of expertise on these insects. The lack of knowledge is of concern because many species are invasive agricultural and economic pests. Conservation of native scarabs and the conservation impact of non-native scarabs is an additional concern. Once established, scarab pests are extremely difficult to dislodge, and a full range of technologies and controls is needed for their eradication (Jackson and Klein, 2006).\r\nThis key allows you to easily identify adult and immature scarab beetles including established pest species and potential new invasive scarab species. The key includes scarab beetles that are of biosecurity risk, such as the Chinese rose beetle (Adoretus sinicus) and the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), as well as scarab beetles that are beneficial recyclers of cattle dung, such as the gazelle dung beetle (Digitonthophagus gazella) and tumble bugs. The scarab and stag beetle fauna of Hawaii is of global origin, with non-native species hailing from Australia, Africa, North America, Asia, and Europe. Only five stag beetles are native to Hawaii, and these are greatly in need of conservation and study. Guam is a key introduction pathway for many species that have been introduced to Hawaii. This tool may also be useful in other geographic regions that may be impacted by invasive scarab beetles, including Florida, California, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and the American Pacific. It is designed for people with varying degrees of knowledge, from outdoor enthusiasts to research scientists.\r\n",

Each unit describes the function of one of six parts of the brain and ways in which alcohol use can disrupt this function. Each unit also provides facts related to underage alcohol use that will be of interest to this age group.<\/p>Four of the six units feature a narrated scenario that enables students to consider how they might respond to a situation involving alcohol use. Students can video-record their responses individually or as a team. Teachers can have the students replay their responses, now combined with the scenario, for class discussion. Alternatively, teachers may ask students to describe their responses to the scenario in a writing assignment. The remaining two units feature a card-matching game and a word scramble, both of which reinforce the content in those units.<p>Students who complete all six units are rewarded with access to the Brain Snatchers game. Teacher materials include a discussion guide with key concepts, objectives, and questions; suggested cross-curricular use of the app's content; and a list of resources related to underage alcohol use. Content is presented in both print and audio to make this app accessible to all students.<\/p>",

This series of Toolbox Talks was created using data from two sources: interviews with SSGA mine workers about hazards and risks at their worksite, and nonfatal and fatal injury data reported to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) during the years 2009-2014. Each Toolbox Talk includes a quote from a mine worker to demonstrate a first person experience with a hazard or risk. This first person experience is then linked to MSHA injury data to show that these experiences are consistent with the realities of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Finally, several questions are included that can be used to start a discussion about a specific Toolbox Talk topic - for instance, questions for the slips and falls topic are focused on having mine workers identify where slips and falls are likely to occur at their mine site and ways mine workers can protect themselves from slip and fall injuries. Altogether there are 13 talks included in this series.",

The color and shape coded status indicators inform the user if model aircraft operation is prohibited, requires the user to take certain actions, or if there are no FAA operating restrictions other than flying safely. All model aircraft operations must always yield the right-of-way to manned aircraft.\r\n",
