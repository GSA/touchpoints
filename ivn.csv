APHIS Priority Goals 2023,"AC 2: Increase recruitment, hiring and career development of veterinarians in inspector positions, while decreasing attrition through the use of incentives.  ","Increase targeted recruitment, non-competitive hiring, and the use of incentives for VMO positions in order to reduce the number of vacancies and attrition, as well as increase facility inspections. Increase the number of personnel recruited into the Candidate Evaluation Program, increase outreach efforts, and increase opportunities for employee development.","Goal 1: Cultivate a talented, diverse, and public service focused workforce where employees are supported, valued, and engaged.","Of the estimated 2.2 million federal employees, 43% are age 50 or older. For APHIS, the percentage of employees in this age bracket is even higher, at 46%. Over the next 5 years, APHIS will focus on recruiting new talent to ensure the agency’s institutional knowledge is maintained as older workers leave the workforce.

As USDA works to address rural housing challenges, Rural Development will improve delivery of its housing programs and resources by embedding key Departmental priorities such as climate and equity. This includes continuing to identify opportunities to make housing more accessible, expanding outreach into underserved rural and Tribal communities, and committing to creating more sustainable and energy efficient housing.

Poorly designed, out of date, and inequitable Government services are a cost to our Nation; it can mean that Veterans don’t get benefits they have earned, small business owners can’t access financing to grow their businesses, new mothers and infants lack critical nutrition supports, and disaster survivors face mountains of paperwork to rebuild their homes.
Opportunity: The Federal Government must deliver a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience, on par with or more effective than leading consumer experiences. Irrespective of people’s age, location, digital savvy, disability, education, or English proficiency, the American people deserve a Government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them. Every interaction between the Government and the public is an opportunity to deliver the services people expect and deserve. Whether during a pivotal life experience such as retiring, or a routine interaction to renew a passport, the Government must build our understanding of our customers and involve them – the people we serve – to improve benefits, services, and programs and enable us to deliver for all Americans.
We can get there by using technology to power outstanding experiences; engaging with private-sector and nonprofit organizations; partnering with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; collaborating with other partners to reduce administrative burden of interaction with the Federal Government, simplifying both public-facing and internal processes to improve efficiency, and empowering the Federal workforce so that they can best deliver for the American people.

The current heightened sense of national alert and the administration’s focus on the security of Federal Information Technology (IT) assets requires that USDA take immediate action to secure our systems. Including security early in the information System Life Cycle (SLC)/System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) will usually result in less expensive and more effective security than adding it after a system is operational.  This guide presents a framework for incorporating security into all phases of the SLC/SDLC process, from inception to disposal.  This document is a guide to help agencies select and acquire cost-effective security controls by explaining how to include information system security requirements in appropriate phases of the SLC/SDLC. A general SLC/SDLC is discussed in this guide that includes the following phases: initiation, acquisition/development, implementation, operations/maintenance, and disposition. Each of these five phases includes a minimum set of security steps needed to effectively incorporate security into a system during its development.  An organization will either use the general SLC/SDLC described in this document or will have developed a tailored SLC/SDLC that meets their specific needs.

The Department's prime responsibility is to help maintain sufficient and efficient production capability of farm, forest, water, and rangeland resources for the public benefit, now and in the future, and to encourage and support proper use, management, and conservation of those natural resources. Programs to meet this mission are carried out through research, education, technical and financial assistance to landowners, managers, producers, and consumers, and through management of public land for which the Department is responsible, in cooperation with State and local agencies.  These programs affect habitats and populations of fish and wildlife. Balancing the competing uses for habitats supporting fish and wildlife requires strong, clear policies, relevant programs, and effective actions to sustain and enhance fish and wildlife in desired locations and numbers. More than 2 billion acres of farm, forest, and rangelands in the United States, plus associated water and wetlands provide habitats for over 3,000 species of birds, mammals, fishes, reptiles, and amphibians. Fish and wildlife are important economic, aesthetic, ecological, educational, recreational, and scientific resources. They provide opportunity for hunting, commercial and sport fishing, trapping, and the countless aesthetic rewards of outdoor experiences. Collectively these pursuits have created significant employment opportunity and have generated an important outdoor recreation industry. Fish and wildlife have inherent values as components and indicators of healthy ecosystems. They often demonstrate how altered environments may effect changes in quality of life for humans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recognizes an important role in the stewardship of the Nation's heritage of fish and wildlife for present and future generations.

Unlawful discrimination contradicts all of USDA’s foundational responsibilities—integrity, consistency, dedication, fairness, mutual respect and professional excellence—and it will not be tolerated.  Every employee, applicant, and program recipient is entitled to be treated with dignity, equality, and respect.  Therefore, every USDA employee, no matter their title or role, is accountable for respecting Constitutional rights and complying with the civil rights laws of the United States.   USDA has already taken several significant steps to promote such accountability by reducing bureaucratic barriers to civil rights.  For example, over the past year, we have substantially reduced the number of days required for investigation of administrative employment complaints.  We are now meeting legal requirements and, more importantly, demonstrating that complaints of discrimination are taken seriously.  Each accepted complaint is promptly investigated and carefully considered on the merits.  However, more is required.

USDA Directives,"USDA SM 1077-004, Climate Resilience and Carbon Stewardship of America's National Forests and Grasslands","On January 27, 2021, this Administration responded to the climate crisis through President Biden’s Executive Order (EO) 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which included the America the Beautiful initiative to conserve thirty percent of lands and waters by 2030.  USDA followed the President’s order with a comprehensive Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience, which provides broad direction to overcome risks and generate solutions on our forests through wildfire risk reduction, climate-informed reforestation and restoration, applied science, and carbon stewardship.  The Department and the USFS are taking additional actions consistent with EO 14008, including a rulemaking proposing to restore the 2001 Roadless Rule on the Tongass National Forest and developing a USFS Climate Adaptation Plan.  Most recently, on Earth Day 2022, President Biden issued EO 14072, Strengthening the Nation’s Forests, Communities, and Local Economies, directing USDA, in partnership with other Federal agencies, to take actions to inventory old growth and mature forests, accelerate reforestation, create and sustain jobs in the sustainable forest product sector, and develop policies to institutionalize these actions.  e. To complement the Departmentwide climate strategy and address one of the most significant risks to our forested land, the USFS issued the Confronting the Wildfire Crisis strategy earlier this year.  Our national forests coevolved with fire, deliberately set by native Americans or resulting from lightning strikes.  Periodic and, in some forest ecosystems, frequent fire caused many forests to be “patchier” and more open with widely spaced trees.  More than a century of deliberate wildfire suppression strategies from Federal and state agencies and others have left many forests significantly different from their historic conditions and vulnerable to uncharacteristic and catastrophic fires.  The climate crisis is exacerbating these unhealthy conditions through widespread drought, insect and disease mortality, and an increase in extreme weather events.  At the same time, the number of people living in or near wildland forests has increased dramatically, creating additional challenges in protecting lives, communities, infrastructure, and natural resources from wildfire.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (herein “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law” or “BIL”), Public Law 117-58, combined with our annual appropriations, provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to invest in significant new landscape-level restoration efforts to support resilient forest ecosystems and forest-adjacent communities.

Analysis shows that in FY 2014, Forest Service programs and projects contributed nearly 360,000 jobs and more than $30 billion in gross domestic product. Timber sales from National Forests benefit forest health and provide raw material for local timber industries, sustaining local jobs. National Forest System lands include the Nation’s largest trail system, more than 5,000 campgrounds, 30,000 recreation areas, 2 million acres of lakes, 200,000 miles of fishable streams, and 120 downhill ski areas – some of the most diverse outdoor recreation opportunities in the world. Outfitters and guides support recreation activities on the National Forests, contributing to local economies across the country and helping millions of forest visitors enjoy their experience.

Balancing land-based production activities in rural communities requires a landscape approach to conservation. Productive agricultural landscapes that are also inviting for tourism and recreation include: clean and available water, healthy wetlands, streams and rivers, abundant fish and wildlife, and productive, healthy soils for crops, livestock, and forestry. In many cases, the economic drivers of production for one purpose may put pressure on the rural assets in another sector, which can be mitigated through USDA assistance. Sustainable forestry or grazing practices based on good conservation systems can enhance the local economy and continue to provide the landscape views that attract other opportunities. In some cases, there is an asset in the landscape that is an anchor for both economic and environmental vitality. When these key rural assets are conserved through prioritized and focused USDA program assistance, the entire agricultural landscape benefits, both in terms of land-based production activities in one sector and recreational activities in another.","5.3.1 Acreage enrolled in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) riparian and grass buffers (Cumulative, Million Acres)","5.3.1 Acreage enrolled in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) riparian and grass buffers (Cumulative, Million Acres)",USDA APP 2022 (Maps to USDA Strat Plan 2018-2022),"GPRA, OMB A-11",https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-strategic-plan-2018-2022.pdf,https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy22-annual-performance-plan.pdf,USDA,USDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opportunity: The Federal Government must deliver a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience, on par with or more effective than leading consumer experiences. Irrespective of people’s age, location, digital savvy, disability, education, or English proficiency, the American people deserve a Government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them. Every interaction between the Government and the public is an opportunity to deliver the services people expect and deserve. Whether during a pivotal life experience such as retiring, or a routine interaction to renew a passport, the Government must build our understanding of our customers and involve them – the people we serve – to improve benefits, services, and programs and enable us to deliver for all Americans.
We can get there by using technology to power outstanding experiences; engaging with private-sector and nonprofit organizations; partnering with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; collaborating with other partners to reduce administrative burden of interaction with the Federal Government, simplifying both public-facing and internal processes to improve efficiency, and empowering the Federal workforce so that they can best deliver for the American people.

Given the changing nature of work, new technology, and the evolving skills needed to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, we must invest in our public servants who are the backbone of our Government.
Opportunity: Federal agencies must attract, hire, develop, and empower talented individuals who are well suited and well prepared to face the challenges the Government faces, both in the near and long term. Agencies must also use what they have learned about the resilience and adaptability of the Federal workforce to make the Federal Government an ideal, modern, and forward-thinking employer.

The numbers of acres protected through a closed conservation easement are being negatively impacted by several different factors.  The 2018 Farm Bill provided level funding for ACEP easements annually throughout the life of the bill. At the same time, though, land prices nationally are climbing. As a result, the number of easements and easement acres protected with that funding drops annually.  Landowners are also canceling existing agreements or failing to pursue new agreements in some states due to higher land values leading to sales outside conservation and/or better opportunities with other programs. Additionally, normal day-to-day issues such as boundary discrepancies, staffing, and weather can affect the timeline for closings.

Opportunity: The Federal Government must deliver a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience, on par with or more effective than leading consumer experiences.

As USDA works to address rural housing challenges, Rural Development will improve delivery of its housing programs and resources by embedding key Departmental priorities such as climate and equity. This includes continuing to identify opportunities to make housing more accessible, expanding outreach into underserved rural and Tribal communities, and committing to creating more sustainable and energy efficient housing. In doing so, Rural Development will help keep families in rural America financially secure in their homes, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Investment in Underserved, Socially Disadvantaged, and Vulnerable Rural and Tribal Communities in Field-Based Programs (Million Dollars)","There are three phases of the Equity Project: (1) Engagement, (2) Technical Assistance (TA), and (3) Investment. RD is focused on the Engagement phase, but all three phases will be fully implemented by FY 2024. RD plans to add new communities for the field to engage each year. RD will also leverage the Rural Partners Network (RPN) for seeking partners to provide TA. RD will on its own and with partners invest in equity communities. RD has incorporated funding requests in the FY 2024 budget draft for staff to deliver programs. Continued engagement to all 8,000 census tracks identified in the project will be at risk without additional field staff to do the engagement and deliver RD's programs to other rural areas.

This creates an enterprise-level opportunity to lean on Federal systems for managing the business of Government—the goods and services we buy and the financial assistance and resources we provide and oversee—to create and sustain good quality union jobs, address persistent racial and wealth gaps, and address other challenges our Nation faces. The Administration has already taken bold action to leverage Federal acquisition and financial assistance to take on our most pressing challenges as a country. Accomplishing these ambitious goals and activities collectively will also require continuous improvements in our procurement, financial assistance, and financial management ecosystems. This shift will require new measures and processes, new training for the Federal workforce, and new tradeoffs that agencies together will need to address going forward.
Opportunity: We can harness this collective power and make connections across the Federal acquisition and financial assistance systems to strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base and support American workers, catalyze new solutions that address the climate crisis and enhance sustainability, and advance equity. The public will benefit from a Government that buys together and manages financial assistance together, devoting attention to how these systems deliver results—prosperity, security, and opportunity—for all people in this country. Federal agencies will look across existing Administration initiatives to ensure that system-wide, continuous improvement in Federal acquisition and financial management systems occurs.

This includes continuing to identify opportunities to make housing more accessible, expanding outreach into underserved rural and Tribal communities, and committing to creating more sustainable and energy efficient housing.
