As we continue to seek input on how to improve the REL program, we would like to use this opportunity to get your feedback on the cross-REL working group(s) you are a part of. For the purposes of this survey, we’re referring to the leadership area cross-REL groups rather than the task level communities of practice (e.g., the dissemination CoP, toolkit CoP).<br><br>

While we are asking you to think about the specific working group(s) that you participate in, <b>we are not evaluating that working group or the REL leading that working group.</b> We are looking at the information in the aggregate to determine if our current working group structure is the best way to accomplish the goals stated in the PWS. The goals stated in the PWS are:<br><br> 

(1) strengthen and leverage the knowledge and experience across the REL Program on a topic,<br     />
(2) increase collaboration and coordination across all RELs, and<br     />   
(3) generate Task 4, Task 5, and Task 6 products that benefit the REL Program, REL partners and education stakeholders broadly.<br><br>

Please take a few minutes to respond to the questions in this survey by <b> Monday, August 26.</b> Your responses will be integral to our ability to ensure that these cross-REL working groups are worth the time and effort you invest in participating in them.

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Survey of HUD/FHA Customer Satisfaction. We thank you in advance for your participation!
</p>
<p>
You recently contacted the Federal Housing Administration's FHA Resource Center either by telephone (1-800-CALLFHA) or by email (answers@hud.gov). During that contact your call/email was escalated to a HUD Office in order to provide additional information or policy clarification on your question. The questions contained in this survey are specific to your experience with the HUD Office or HUD staff person to whom you were escalated.
</p>
<p>
Responding to this survey is voluntary, completely anonymous and should take less than three minutes to complete. No personal information is collected or maintained in conjunction with your response to this survey. HUD obtained approval to conduct this survey from the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3090-0321. That authority expires on 10/31/2022. HUD may not collect this information, and you are not required to respond, after that expiration date.
</p>
<p>
The results of this survey will be used to help evaluate the customer service performance and level of service provided to industry and consumer clients seeking information on Federal Housing Administration programs. Your responses, in combination with those of other clients, will help HUD to determine the effectiveness of this critical information resource and their ability to meet the expectations ",    ,a11,,,2019-12-04T19:42:14.146Z,2024-12-05T23:40:23.257Z,,,FALSE,Thank you.

As part of that transition, CMS plans to migrate the Minimum Data Set (MDS) functionality (i.e., MDS record submissions & reporting) to iQIES on or about April 15th, 2023. For some States, part of the MDS functionality has been to receive what CMS calls a ‘nightly extract file’, which is basically an MDS data file delivered nightly to the requesting State in a predetermined format and location. The aforementioned system migration will force CMS to alter how it will deliver these data files. The following two-question survey is intended to inform CMS regarding State capabilities with respect to their ability to utilize Application Program Interface (API) technology to support this effort.",,custom,,,2023-01-06T16:47:45.518Z,2024-12-05T23:40:24.849Z,,,FALSE,"Thank you for sharing your insight with us.

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Survey of HUD/FHA Customer Satisfaction. We thank you in advance for your participation!
</p>
<p>
You recently contacted the Federal Housing Administration's FHA Resource Center either by telephone (1-800-CALLFHA) or by email (answers@hud.gov). During that contact your call/email was escalated to a HUD Office in order to provide additional information or policy clarification on your question. The questions contained in this survey are specific to your experience with the HUD Office or HUD staff person to whom you were escalated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Responding to this survey is voluntary, completely anonymous and should take less than three minutes to complete. No personal information is collected or maintained in conjunction with your response to this survey. HUD obtained approval to conduct this survey from the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0690-0030. That authority expires on 10/31/2022. HUD may not collect this information, and you are not required to respond, after that expiration date.
</p>
<p>
The results of this survey will be used to help evaluate the customer service performance and level of service provided to industry and consumer clients seeking information on Federal Housing Administration programs. Your responses, in combination with those of other clients, will help HUD to determine the effectiveness of this critical information resource and their ability to meet the expectations of this agency.
</p>
<p>
Participation in this Survey is voluntary and you may quit at any time without penalty. While HUD referred you to this Survey, your participation and all responses are anonymous. This means that participation in this Survey will not affect the services, loan decisions, or oversight you receive from this agency. If you have any questions about the Survey, please contact the Survey Team at fhasurvey@hud.gov.

To this end, cross-agency sharing of best practices will be crucial for reducing costs and eliminating duplication of effort as AI becomes more integrated into our day-to-day processes. To further promote this collaboration, sharing your experiences to date and potentially offering managed services to assist other agencies in their AI journey will be key. To help us build this community, we ask that you answer the following questions and provide relevant artifacts.

The questionnaire is organized into four categories: people, process, technology, and data. Each category touches on the entire AI lifecycle. You may skip any questions that you do not feel comfortable answering.

1) Evaluation Officers and their representative(s)<br>
2) Evaluation offices/units within a larger agency, component, or bureau<br>
3) Evaluation offices/units within small or independent agencies<br><br>

We recommend that the survey is completed by whoever in your office is best positioned to answer these questions. <b>When in doubt, fill it out!</b><br><br>

 We will use the results of this survey for a working paper that will be shared with the Evidence and Evaluation Community of Practice. Those responding to the survey will have an opportunity to review a draft of the working paper. <br><br> 

This survey has two parts. We estimate that it will take 20-30 minutes to complete. <br>

Federal laws and Executive directives require agencies to frequently consult with the public to inform regulations, policies, program and service design, and other actions. However, these consultation efforts may be perceived as inaccessible, convoluted, or disconnected from the interests and priorities of impacted stakeholders. According to the 2023 Partnership for Public Service (PPS) survey on trust in government, only about 1 in 5 Americans believe that the Federal Government “listens to the public” or “is transparent.”

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in partnership with Federal agencies and the public, is working to develop a government-wide framework, common guidelines, and leading practices for public participation and community engagement (PPCE or “participation and engagement”). This framework is meant to enable agencies to more frequently, effectively, broadly, and meaningfully involve the public, including underserved communities, and other stakeholders in government decision-making. 

Through this feedback request, OMB seeks input on the experiences of individuals and organizations with informing Federal Government decision-making and participating in engagement activities with government agencies; examples of leading practices in this space; and other recommendations on available methods, approaches, and tools that could assist in the effort to develop and implement a Federal framework for participation and engagement. OMB welcomes input from a wide and diverse array of stakeholders in the public, private, advocacy, not-for-profit, and philanthropic sectors, including State, local, Tribal, and territorial areas.

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Survey of HUD/FHA Customer Satisfaction. We thank you in advance for your participation!
</p>
<p>
You recently contacted the Federal Housing Administration's FHA Resource Center either by telephone (1-800-CALLFHA) or by email (answers@hud.gov). During that contact your call/email was escalated to a HUD Office in order to provide additional information or policy clarification on your question. The questions contained in this survey are specific to your experience with the HUD Office or HUD staff person to whom you were escalated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Responding to this survey is voluntary, completely anonymous and should take less than three minutes to complete. No personal information is collected or maintained in conjunction with your response to this survey. HUD obtained approval to conduct this survey from the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0690-0030. That authority expires on 10/31/2022. HUD may not collect this information, and you are not required to respond, after that expiration date.
</p>
<p>
The results of this survey will be used to help evaluate the customer service performance and level of service provided to industry and consumer clients seeking information on Federal Housing Administration programs. Your responses, in combination with those of other clients, will help HUD to determine the effectiveness of this critical information resource and their ability to meet the expectations of this agency.
</p>
<p>
Participation in this Survey is voluntary and you may quit at any time without penalty. While HUD referred you to this Survey, your participation and all responses are anonymous. This means that participation in this Survey will not affect the services, loan decisions, or oversight you receive from this agency. If you have any questions about the Survey, please contact the Survey Team at fhasurvey@hud.gov.

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s survey of the Department's Frequently Asked Question site (www.hud.gov/answers). We thank you in advance for your participation!
</p>
<p>
As a visitor to the FHA frequently asked question site (www.hud.gov/answers), we are very interested in obtaining your feedback on the quality of that experience. The questions below are specific to your experience on the FAQ site - NOT on the overall agency site (www.hud.gov).
</p>

<p>
Responding to this survey is voluntary, completely anonymous and should take less than three minutes to complete. No personal information is collected or maintained in conjunction with your response to this survey. HUD obtained approval to conduct this survey from the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0690-0030. That authority expires on 10/31/2022. HUD may not collect this information, and you are not required to respond, after that expiration date.
</p>
<p>
The results of this survey will be used to help evaluate the customer service performance and level of service provided to industry and consumer clients seeking information on Federal Housing Administration programs. Your responses, in combination with those of other clients, will help HUD to determine the effectiveness of this critical information resource and their ability to meet the expectations of this agency.
</p>
<p>
Participation in this Survey is voluntary and you may quit at any time without penalty. While HUD referred you to this Survey, your participation and all responses are anonymous.

The theme for the June roundtable is “Implementation Successes.” The roundtable will feature updates from FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG leaders on their federal EHR efforts as well as interactive discussion panels focused on success stories related to implementing and using the federal EHR and exchanging health data to enhance the delivery of health care for Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries.


This event will be virtual via Microsoft Teams and is open to the public. We invite active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience. Additional details regarding the agenda and meeting will be distributed to registered participants prior to the event.

1944,Evaluation Project Proposals,"High Value, Low Cost Evaluation Project Proposals","OMB is specifically interested in evaluation projects that were unfunded or underfunded in FY 22 (through appropriations or supplemental funding from Congress), and that would require between $50,000 to $200,000 to fully execute. Any Evaluation Officer or other evaluation unit/office in a Federal agency with an innovative and policy-relevant idea for a high value, low cost evaluation project that will generate learning that would benefit a few agencies (such as those with shared missions or goals) or all agencies (such as insights on government processes) may submit a proposal. The projects do not need to take place or conclude in FY 22, but the agency must be able to complete an interagency agreement and accept funds from OMB no later than August 31, 2022. Agencies must also commit to beginning the work no later than the fall of FY 23, make project plans and results publicly available, and provide OMB with ongoing updates and results.

2559,MPTest,MPTest,"TEST INSTRUCTIONS
Few wars in American history have so divided the country as did the Vietnam War. Yet hundreds of thousands of men and women answered their nation’s call to fight.

More than 58,000 made the ultimate sacrifice, and hundreds of thousands more were injured – physically, psychologically, or both – returning to a nation that often spat on them or called them “baby killers.”

Many didn’t separate the war from the warrior. It was a painful chapter in American history.

Fifty years ago on March 29, 1973, the last U.S. combat troops left South Vietnam, ending direct U.S. military involvement in the war. March 29 is now National Vietnam War Veterans Day, established to thank and honor Vietnam Veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice.

It’s a thanks many didn’t receive when they came home.",,custom,,,2023-04-03T13:01:59.949Z,2024-12-05T23:40:28.369Z,,,FALSE,Thank you.

4679,VMWare,"Challenges and Alternatives Due to Shifts in VMware Product, Pricing, and Delivery Model","Background: On November 22, 2023, Broadcom made a significant impact on the IT industry by acquiring VMware. Broadcom introduced significant alterations to its then-current licensing model by ending perpetual licensing and implementing major changes to its partner network, including how customers interact with resellers and Broadcom. Additionally, Broadcom made changes to the product packaging and bundling. 

Summary of changes:
VMware will no longer offer Perpetual Licenses; they will only sell subscription licenses
All customers who own perpetual licenses and who are using perpetual licenses must buy subscription licenses to maintain support once their VMware agreement expires
Broadcom ended VMware existing partner network requiring all resellers and service providers to reapply
Consolidated offerings into two main bundles VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere Foundation and will not sell stand alone VMware products
New licensing and product offerings, including the shift to subscription models and changes to portfolio
VMware canceled all Product Activation Codes (PACs) that have not been activated 

These changes have a direct impact on pricing due to unavailability of stand alone products and bundling leading to higher costs, sweeping changes to the license model, and overall higher costs. ","Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes
Your responses will be used to help us understand the challenges faced by federal agencies due to the significant shift to VMware’s licensing  licensing model. This information will assist us in developing a Government-wide Request for Information (RFI) to search for alternatives to VMware and gain an understanding of the commercial marketplace for virtualization software, solutions and services. Our intent behind a governmentwide RFI is to assist agencies in understanding the commercial marketplace for virtualization software, solutions, and services. GSA intends to share the results of the RFI with all agency respondents.

Welcome to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Survey of HUD/FHA Customer Satisfaction. We thank you in advance for your participation!
</p>
<p>
You recently contacted the Federal Housing Administration's FHA Resource Center either by telephone (1-800-CALLFHA) or by email (answers@hud.gov). During that contact your call/email was escalated to a HUD Office in order to provide additional information or policy clarification on your question. The questions contained in this survey are specific to your experience with the HUD Office or HUD staff person to whom you were escalated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Responding to this survey is voluntary, completely anonymous and should take less than three minutes to complete. No personal information is collected or maintained in conjunction with your response to this survey. HUD obtained approval to conduct this survey from the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0690-0030. That authority expires on 10/31/2022. HUD may not collect this information, and you are not required to respond, after that expiration date.
</p>
<p>
The results of this survey will be used to help evaluate the customer service performance and level of service provided to industry and consumer clients seeking information on Federal Housing Administration programs. Your responses, in combination with those of other clients, will help HUD to determine the effectiveness of this critical information resource and their ability to meet the expectations of this agency.
</p>
<p>
Participation in this Survey is voluntary and you may quit at any time without penalty. While HUD referred you to this Survey, your participation and all responses are anonymous. This means that participation in this Survey will not affect the services, loan decisions, or oversight you receive from this agency. If you have any questions about the Survey, please contact the Survey Team at fhasurvey@hud.gov.

We want to know which of these practices we should make sure we keep moving forward and those that may need to change. 

For example, we now use Zoom to help teams stay connected and that may also help level the playing field for staff teleworking or working from a field office in a way that did not necessarily exist using the tools GAO had prior to the pandemic.
