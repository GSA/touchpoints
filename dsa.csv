NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

The Act authorized the designation of National Marine Sanctuaries to protect: significant waters and secure habitat for aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing, wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism.

The National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 14 marine protected areas that encompass more than 150,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Florida Keys, and from Lake Huron to American Samoa. The system includes 13 national marine sanctuaries and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.

Designated in 1981, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) spanned 1,279-square-miles (966 square nautical miles) just north and west of San Francisco Bay, and protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, GFNMS expanded north and west of their original boundaries to encompass 3,295 square miles, and changed their name to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. GFNMS has administrative jurisdiction over the northern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz County line northward to the existing boundary between the two sanctuaries. GFNMS maintains an administrative office and public Visitor Center on Crissy Field in the Presidio of San Francisco.

GFNMS is located within the California Current ecosystem, one of four major eastern boundary currents in the world, that stretches along the western coast of North America from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Due to a high degree of wind-driven upwelling, there is a ready supply of nutrients to surface waters and the California Current ecosystem is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world.

GFNMS is a globally significant, extraordinarily diverse, and productive marine ecosystem that supports abundant wildlife and valuable fisheries. It provides breeding and feeding grounds for at least twenty-five endangered or threatened species; thirty-six marine mammal species, including blue, gray, and humpback whales, harbor seals, elephant seals, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and one of the southernmost U.S. populations of threatened Steller sea lions; over a quarter-million breeding seabirds; and one of the most significant white shark populations on the planet.",[]

The refuge’s three units, Big Sandy, Duck River, and Busseltown, stretch for 65 miles along the Tennessee River. Established in 1945, the refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge provides a major wintering area for migrating waterfowl. Currently the refuge habitats include agricultural crops; natural plants that grown in moist soil conditions, vegetated wetlands, and forest lands. The resulting combination of agricultural grains, natural foods and protected areas sustains waterfowl through the winter months. The refuge also provides habitat for resident wildlife species and other migratory birds. The refuge’s diversity of habitats also supports breeding, wintering and migration habitat for 301 bird species and habitat for 51 mammals, 89 reptiles and amphibians and 144 species of fish. White-tailed deer can be found throughout the area, along with smaller animals such as raccoons, foxes, squirrels, beaver, rabbits and wild turkey. In addition to being a home to wildlife, the refuge offers many recreational opportunities such as: hunting, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, and photography. The refuge offers three hiking trails, four wildlife observation decks, multiple boat ramps and fishing decks. The refuge also provides the perfect outdoor classroom for environmental education and interpretation activities. Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge is open during daylight hours. ",[]

To ensure continued preservation so the next generation can experience and enjoy all these places have to offer, we must look to a future generation of stewards who can lead the charge. That is why the Every Kid in a Park program is an effort to inspire every child to get outside and learn about the rich history and culture of our nation and the natural wonders of our federal lands and waters.
Every Kid in a Park grants every 4th grader in the country and their family, free access to these beautiful places for one full year.

Fighting Malaria and Saving Lives.,"President George W. Bush created the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, when malaria was almost certainly a death sentence for poor children in Africa. President Barack Obama embraced the effort and also significantly expanded PMI’s program reach. And, bipartisan leadership from the House and Senate has sustained our work. With PMI support, hundreds of millions of people have benefited from protective measures and have been diagnosed and treated for malaria. Malaria’s impact is especially ferocious on the poorest: those least able to afford preventive measures and medical treatment. Thus, USAID through PMI has reached into the poorest of communities in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria flourishes, arming women, children, and families with tools to protect themselves from malaria and providing them with fast-acting medicines to cure malaria if they do become infected.

Fighting Malaria and Saving Lives.,"President George W. Bush created the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, when malaria was almost certainly a death sentence for poor children in Africa. President Barack Obama embraced the effort and also significantly expanded PMI’s program reach. And, bipartisan leadership from the House and Senate has sustained our work. With PMI support, hundreds of millions of people have benefited from protective measures and have been diagnosed and treated for malaria. Malaria’s impact is especially ferocious on the poorest: those least able to afford preventive measures and medical treatment. Thus, PMI has reached into the poorest of communities in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria flourishes, arming women, children, and families with tools to protect themselves from malaria and providing them with fast-acting medicines to cure malaria if they do become infected. PMI has also brought much needed attention to address drug resistant malaria in the Asia’s Mekong region. PMI has programs in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and three countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia. ",[]

Follow us on Facebook ,"From the deep seafloor around the Channel Islands to the heights of the Alaska Range, from the Cesar E. Chavez monument in California, to the legacy captured at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington D.C., our federal lands and waters should be experienced and enjoyed by every American, especially our youth. 
To ensure continued preservation so the next generation can experience and enjoy all these places have to offer, we must look to a future generation of stewards who can lead the charge. That is why the Every Kid in a Park Initiative is an effort to inspire every child to get outside and learn about the rich history and culture of our nation and the natural wonders of our federal lands and waters.
The Every Kid in a Park initiative grants every 4th grader in the country and their family, free access to these beautiful places for one full year. 
Our federal lands and waters also serve as an innovative resource educators can use to inspire learning in important subjects like history, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts and can help make teaching and learning fun. Educators interested in taking advantage of this special teaching and learning opportunity can go to the website to access fun and engaging learning activities, aligned to standard.",[]

Under this system of protection, American industry has flourished. New products have been invented, new uses for old ones discovered, and employment opportunities created for millions of Americans. The strength and vitality of the U.S. economy depends directly on effective mechanisms that protect new ideas and investments in innovation and creativity. The continued demand for patents and trademarks underscores the ingenuity of American inventors and entrepreneurs. The USPTO is at the cutting edge of the Nation’s technological progress and achievement.

Make the most of your world. Share your story with #peacecorpsthegambia,"Since 1967 more than 1,700 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in The Gambia. Currently around 90 volunteers serve in one of three technical sectors: Education, Health, and Environment. Due to the size of The Gambia (it is the smallest country in mainland Africa) volunteers are able to collaborate on many projects, with particularly strong cross-sector initiatives in the areas of Gender-and-Development (GAD) and Food Security.

Peace Corps Volunteers come from diverse backgrounds in the United States. They represent a wide range of ages, religions, and ethnicities, and have vastly differing skills and experience. But they have all come with one thing in common: they want to learn about The Gambia and Gambians and share their skills to effect change.

Almost every Peace Corps Volunteer in The Gambia lives with a host family in a mud or concrete block compound. This proximity, sharing meals and becoming part of a family, helps volunteers to learn Gambian culture and language and to develop close ties to their communities – an integral factor in the development work that they undertake.

Take a look at some of the projects we’re involved in – we’ll update our Facebook page with stories, pictures, news articles, and Peace Corps events. Like the page if you’d like to keep up with the work that we do here.",[]

Working hand in hand with the Sector’s six Motor Life Boat Stations, the Coast Guard Cutter Orcas, and Coos Bay Aids to Navigation (ANT) team, the Air Station’s crews stand a 24/7 watch protecting those at sea and inland.

Although beautiful, the rugged Oregon coast can become dangerous at a moment’s notice. Notoriously strong winds, powerful waves in excess of 40 feet, unpredictable fog, blinding rain, steep cliffs, remote mountains, and thousands of miles of rivers create unique challenges for our helicopter and boat crews. From inland mountain rescues of injured loggers and hikers, to at sea search and rescue cases of sinking vessels or lost fishermen, the members of Sector North Bend stand a vigilant watch no matter the conditions.

Sector North Bend protects the environment with the clear understanding that the quality of people's lives and livelihoods depend on diligent stewardship of our nation's maritime resources. All of our missions are accomplished through vigilance, tenacity, teamwork, a commitment to service, community, and the unwavering pursuit of operational excellence.",[]

It was a simple structure manned by a single keeper and sparsely equipped. In case of an emergency, the keeper had to rouse a volunteer crew before any rescue attempt. In 1892, Station Coos Bay was moved from the lighthouse to the North Spit of Coos Bay and was a fully manned station. The station moved again in 1915. This time it moved from the North Spit to the lee side of Coos Head promontory. A larger station was built consisting of a main administration building and quarters, a boathouse, a workshop and one house reserved for the officerin charge.

In August of 1961, Ghana became the first country in the world to receive Peace Corps Volunteers. After nearly 54 years of uninterrupted collaboration, we have roughly 130 Volunteers serving in all 10 regions of the country, at any given time. Our volunteers generally serve in three capacity building sectors: health, education and agriculture. Additionally, the majority of our volunteers work in one or more of the following cross-sector initiatives: HIV/AIDS Awareness & Prevention; Food Security; and Gender & Youth Development.

The goals of Peace Corps Ghana are to promote sustainable development, and to build mutual cultural understanding on the part of Americans and Ghanaians. We achieve these goals by encouraging our volunteers to work with community members to address issues in ways that are sensitive to the cultural values and consistent with the available resources of their communities. Our volunteers supplement host country efforts, they do not serve as a substitute for those efforts. Our volunteers work with an aim of reducing dependency through achievement of developmental goals defined by the Ghanaian government.

We believe that ""development"" is a learning process, in which the people involved are developing skills, know-how, confidence, and the ability to identify and address issues that affect them on a daily basis. Peace Corps Ghana is proud of the role that we have played in Ghana’s development as an independent nation. We look forward to remaining an active partner with Ghana as she strives towards achieving ""middle income country"" status by 2020.",[]

","In 2006 the National Institute of Health (NIH) developed the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) Research Grant Program to foster the research and development of new and improved therapeutics to reduce mortality and morbidity during and/or after civilian chemical emergency events. To date, there has been considerable progress in the areas of target identification, hit and lead development, and preclinical studies. Investigators have identified several molecular entities that show promise as novel targets for therapeutic discovery and development. In vitro and in vivo models for screening are being developed and validated against human and animal efficacy studies. These models have produced several novel compounds with biological activity that is now being tested in proof-of-principle studies with more advanced animal models. There has also been progress in developing new indications for several FDA-approved drugs. Investigators have published over 800 articles in some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals in science, including reports of important discoveries that have implications beyond chemical defense. Over a half dozen compounds have been identified as lead compounds, and several meetings (pre-IND, IND, and NDA) with the FDA have already occurred. One drug is poised for possible FDA approval and government procurement for the SNS very soon.

Of the nearly 90,000 Tribal members that make up the 24 Tribes under the Southern Plains jurisdiction, 55,000 live within the three State service areas, which stretch from the Texas/Mexico border, across West central Oklahoma before finally ending in Northern Kansas.
Within that area the Southern Plains Regional Office (SPRO) is located in Anadarko, Oklahoma as is the Anadarko Agency. The additional three agencies under the SPRO are the Pawnee Agency located in Pawnee, Oklahoma, the Concho Agency located in El Reno, Oklahoma, and the Horton Agency located in Horton, Kansas. The service area is comprised of 585,000 acres of Trust property contained within 13,000 highly fractionated tracts. This high fractionation makes for a challenging work environment at the Regional Office and the individual Agencies.
The following tribes are serviced under the Southern Plains Regional Office:
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe - Located in Livingston, Texas with 993 enrolled members
Kickapoo Traditional Tribe - Located in Eagle Pass, Texas with 880 enrolled members
Absentee Shawnee Tribe - Located in Shawnee, Oklahoma with 2,926 enrolled members
Citizen Potawatomi Nation - Located in Shawnee, Oklahoma with 23,557 enrolled members

Kickapoo Tribe - Located in McLoud, Oklahoma with 2,505 enrolled members
Sac and Fox Nation - Located in Stroud, Oklahoma with 3,025 enrolled members
Branch of Natural Resources, Division of Wildland Fire Management
The Division provides services related to planning, coordination, and evaluating programs in the fields of Natural Resources, Forestry and Wildland Fire Management while providing assistance to protect and enhance the value of Indian Trust assets. Emphasis is placed on improving these resources through hazardous fuels reduction, Reserved Treaty Rights Lands projects, and assisting agricultural programs through prescribed burning. While hazardous fuels removal (Eastern Red Cedar eradication) is the main driver, the Wildland Fire Management program provides suppression resources for local wildland fires and supports Oklahoma Forestry Service, Volunteer Fire Departments, Tribal Departments, and other Federal Interagency Partners within the State.

Our social media content will cater primarily to this audience in addition to current Volunteers, returned Volunteers, family and friends, partner organizations, and HCNs.  This social media presence, while focusing strongly on recruitment messaging, will also seek to reach these additional audiences when creating and posting content, as well as to provide a broader prospective of PC Fiji’s activities.  


Content:

In order to maximize viewership, multiple social media applications will be used.  An ongoing effort will be made to represent the diversity of and within the Agency, Fiji culture and its Volunteers.

It is, of course, as it was intended to be, a national shrine. The events that took place here two centuries ago, and the buildings and objects associated with them, are what attract visitors from every state in the Union and almost every country around the globe. This place where our nation began arouses deep feelings. The attentive silence of the crowds in the Assembly Room is a testament to this emotion. So is the awe on the faces of children as they view the Liberty Bell for the first time. But Independence is more than an object of reverence. It is also a place to be reminded of the ideals that formed the basis for the founding of the United States, and on which its continued survival depends. And as they tour the park, visitors are made aware that the formation of this nation was the work of men, imperfect like themselves, who transcended their faults and foibles to create an enduring democracy, the oldest in the world and a model for free men everywhere.",[]

Documentation produced through HABS/HAER/HALS constitutes the nation's largest archive of historic architectural, engineering, and landscape documentation. Records on more than 40,000 historic sites (consisting of large-format black and white photographs, measured drawings, and written historical reports) are maintained in a special collection at the Library of Congress, available to the public copyright free in both hard copy (at the Library of Congress) and via the Library's website. HDP also develops and maintains the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architectural and Engineering Documentation.

HDP conducts a nationwide documentation program in partnership with state and local governments, private industry, professional societies, universities, preservation groups, and other Federal agencies. The program assigns highest priority to sites that are in danger of demolition or loss by neglect, and to National Park Service properties. In addition to the summer recording program, documentation enters the Collection through mitigation activities under appropriate sections of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, submissions in prize competitions, and donations.

Documentation provides a permanent record of the nation's most important historic sites and large-scale objects. The Collection is unique in the strong support it enjoys from its institutional sponsors and the public, and is distinguished in its national scope, consistent format, archival stability, and continued growth. The documentation contributes to wider recognition and appreciation of historic resources as National Historic Landmarks, provides baseline documentation for rehabilitation and restoration, and makes available well-researched materials for interpretation and illustration.

Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park preserves and interprets key historical sites and events related to the American Civil War and the rich cultural heritage of the Shenandoah Valley. This includes the Battle of Cedar Creek, a decisive October 19, 1864 Union victory, and Belle Grove, the antebellum plantation manor house of Isaac Hite, Jr. (brother-in-law of President James Madison).
 
  
A Partnership Park

Cedar Creek and Belle Grove NHP is a ""partnership park,"" in which the National Park Service works with several Key Partners to create and manage the park and its resources. These Key Partners are all non-profit or governmental organizations and include:

•The National Trust for Historic Preservation
•Belle Grove, Inc.
•Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation
•Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation
•Shenandoah County, Virginia

Cedar Creek and Belle Grove NHP is also a park-in-development, created by Congress in 2002. Although there are over 3,700 acres within the park's authorized boundary, over half of this is still privately owned. Therefore, much of the battlefield is not accessible to the public. Nearly all of the remaining land (approximately 1,400 acres) and buildings are preserved and administered by the Key Partners.

The National Park Service works collaboratively with the Grand Portage Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa to interpret and support the heritage and lifeways of the Ojibwe people and to preserve the premier sites, route, and unique historic values of the Grand Portage trail.

As early as 2,000 years ago, indigenous groups used Gitchi Onigamiing “the Great Carrying Place” (Grand Portage) to travel from seasonal homes around Lake Superior to regions of better hunting, fishing, and trapping in the protected interior forests. 

Opened in 1951 as Grand Portage National Historic Site, designated a National Monument in 1958, its nearly 710 acres lie entirely within the boundaries of reservation of the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. The Historic site consists of three reconstructed North West Company buildings on their original locations and an Ojibwe Village exhibit. The Historic site is open seasonally from Memorial Day in May to Indigenous Peoples' Day in October.

The Heritage Center offers interactive exhibits, educational videos, artifacts, and a gift shop. The Heritage Center is open year round.",[]

America’s fire losses today represent a dramatic improvement from more than 40 years ago. In 1971, our nation lost more than 12,000 residents and 250 firefighters to fire. Acting to stop these tragic losses, Congress passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act in 1974. It created the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and the National Fire Academy (NFA). Since that time, through data collection, public education, research and training efforts, USFA has helped to reduce fire deaths and make our communities and residents safer.",[]

To ameliorate some of the key factors contributing to the preclinical to clinical development gap in AD the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Library have created a publically available data repository, Alzheimer’s Preclinical Efficacy Database, AlzPED.   AlzPED is designed as a web-based portal for housing, sharing and mining of preclinical efficacy data. The data are submitted to AlzPED through a curator and gleaned from at least two sources; 1) the scientific literature; 2) directly from researchers.  AlzPED houses information on preclinical studies including animal models descriptors, key elements of the study design, information related to the therapeutic target and therapeutic agent, principal findings and information related to funding source(s) and financial conflict of interest.  The long term goal for AlzPED is to also serve as a platform for reporting unpublished studies in order to mitigate the publication bias that favors the reporting of positive findings. ",[]

A well-known actor, John Wilkes Booth, desperate to aid the dying Confederacy, stepped into the president's box. Booth's decision to pull the trigger altered the nation's power to reconstruct after the war. Booth escaped into the night as Abraham Lincoln was carried to the Petersen boarding house across the street. It was there that President Lincoln died early the next morning, and became the first American president to be assassinated.

Established in 1824, IA currently provides services (directly or through contracts, grants, or compacts) to approximately 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. There are 565 federally recognized American Indian tribes and Alaska Natives in the United States. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is responsible for the administration and management of 55 million surface acres and 57 million acres of subsurface minerals estates held in trust by the United States for American Indian, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives.

12963,Court of Indian Offenses for Southern Plains Region,[],[],facebook,https://www.facebook.com/ciospr/,,English,published,This is the official Facebook page of the Court of Indian Offenses for the Southern Plains Region also known as the CFR Court.,"The first Court of Indian Offenses in the area that was to become the State of Oklahoma was originally established prior to statehood in the Indian Territory in 1886.  The original Court of Indian Offenses was created to provide law enforcement for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache (KCA) reservation.  Several prominent tribal leaders served as judges of the court including Quanah Parker (Comanche), Lone Wolf (Kiowa) and several others.  An Indian police force provided the law enforcement for the KCA, Cheyenne-Arapaho, and other reservations.  Thus, the Court of Indian Offenses pre-dates Oklahoma state courts by several decades. 

After the reservations in Oklahoma were opened by land runs to non-Indian homesteading, and federal Indian policy sought to weaken tribal governments and break up tribal land holdings, the courts over time lost their funding and consequently ceased to function.  With the void in the enforcement of tribal law, the State began to assert its authority over the remaining tribal and allotted Indian lands even though no jurisdiction properly existed.  In recent decades, the Indian tribes have regained the jurisdiction over these lands and have re-established tribal court systems.
The State of Oklahoma once contended that tribal governments had no authority to operate their own justice systems, arguing that the Indian nations had no land remaining under their jurisdictions.  Much confusion arose because many thought that tribes only asserted jurisdiction over “reservation” lands.  Many people in Oklahoma incorrectly assumed that reservations were terminated at statehood.  Recent court decisions have made it clear that tribes assert jurisdiction over all lands that are “Indian country”, including reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments.  These Indian country lands from the basis of tribal jurisdiction today.  Since few Indian tribes had operating judicial systems in place in the late 1970s. When tribal jurisdiction was re-affirmed, the Court of Indian Offenses for the Anadarko Area Tribes was created.  Courts of Indian Offenses are established throughout the U.S. Under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), providing the commonly used name — the “CFR” Court.  Until such time as a particular Indian tribe establishes their own tribal court, the Court of Indian Offenses will act as a tribe’s judicial system.  

When the court was re-established in western Oklahoma in 1979, there were four CFR Courts covering eighteen Indian nations.  A number of tribes have since established their own systems of justice.  Accordingly, the CFR Courts for these tribes have been deactivated.  In 1991, a separate CFR Court system was established for Eastern Oklahoma Region Tribes covering eastern Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Muskogee, Oklahoma. ",[]

The BIA has changed dramatically over the past 185 years, evolving as Federal policies designed to subjugate and assimilate American Indians and Alaska Natives have changed to policies that promote Indian self-determination.

For almost 200 years, dating back to the role it played in negotiating treaty agreements between the United States and tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the BIA has embodied the trust and government-to-government relationships between the U.S. and the Federally recognized tribes. Over the years, the BIA has been involved in the implementation of Federal laws that have directly affected all Americans. The General Allotment Act of 1887 opened tribal lands west of the Mississippi to non-Indian settlers, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted American Indians and Alaska Natives U.S. citizenship and the right to vote, and the New Deal and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 established modern tribal governments. The World War II period of relocation and the post-War termination era of the 1950s led to the activism of the 1960s and 1970s that saw the takeover of the BIA’s headquarters and resulted in the creation of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 along with the Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act have fundamentally changed how the Federal Government and the tribes conduct business with each other.",[]

B-WET currently serves seven areas of the country: California, Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Hawai'i, New England, and the Pacific Northwest. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is an agency in the Department of Commerce with the mission: “To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources” (noaa.gov) NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, is essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Carefully selected experiences driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery and wonder, and nurturing a sense of community will further connect students with their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. B-WET maintains relevance by responding to regional education and environmental priorities through local implementation. Please refer to the regional funding opportunity announcements for specific priorities.

Once common throughout the eastern and southcentral United States, red wolf populations were decimated by the early part of the 20th Century as a result of intensive predator control programs and the degradation and alteration of the species' habitat. The red wolf was designated an endangered species in 1967, and shortly thereafter the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated efforts to conserve the species. Today, more than 100 red wolves roam their native habitats in eastern North Carolina, and nearly 200 red wolves are maintained in captive breeding facilities throughout the United States.",[]

A top priority of the IACB is the implementation and enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (Act), a truth-in-advertising law that provides criminal and civil penalties for marketing products as ""Indian-made"" when such products are not made by Indians, as defined by the Act.","The Indian Arts and Crafts Board (IACB), U.S. Department of the Interior, was created by Congress to promote the economic development of federally recognized* American Indians and Alaska Natives (Indians) through the expansion of the Indian arts and crafts market.  A top priority of the IACB is the implementation and enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (Act), a truth-in-advertising law that provides criminal and civil penalties for marketing products as ""Indian-made"" when such products are not made by Indians, as defined by the Act.

The IACB's other activities include providing professional business advice, information on the Act and related marketing issues, fundraising assistance, and promotional opportunities to Indian artists, craftspeople, and cultural organizations of federally recognized tribes.  The IACB operates three regional museums in the Plains Region, the Sioux Indian Museum, the Museum of the Plains Indian, and the Southern Plains Indian Museum.  The IACB also produces a consumer directory of approximately 400 federally recognized Indian owned and operated arts and crafts businesses.

These activities are not duplicated in either the federal or private sector.  The IACB is the only federal agency that is consistently and exclusively concerned with the economic benefits and cultural development of federally recognized Indians.  The IACB's policies are determined by Commissioners who are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, and serve without compensation.  The IACB's activities and programs are carried out by a professional and experienced staff.

* The IACB provides services, including Source Directory listings, to enrolled members of ""any Indian tribe, band, nation, or Alaska Native village, or other organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians""  (25 U.S.C. § 305e(d)(3)(A)).  The Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. §§ 479a(2), 479a-1, requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish a list of all Indian or Alaska Native tribes, bands, nations, pueblos, villages or communities ""recognize[d] to be eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.""  Consistent with other statutes defining this Department's responsibilities and obligations to Indian tribes, the Department interprets the first definition of Indian tribe in the Indian Arts and Crafts Act as those tribes listed on the tribal entities list published in the Federal Register.

Our program in Egypt, totaling nearly $30 billion since 1978, has directly and fundamentally supported concrete achievements that have improved the lives of and futures of Egyptians.

We have helped to eliminate polio and significantly reduce infant and maternal mortality rates. There are libraries in all 39,000 public schools in Egypt due to USAID support, and we are working to ensure that all children learn to read in the first grade. We improved and expanded telecommunications networks, which was critical to Egypt’s ability to increase trade and investment. In greater Cairo, we supported the reduction of lead levels in the air by more than 65 percent. We helped to decentralize the water and sanitation sector and have improved water and wastewater facilities in Greater Cairo, the North Coast, and Upper Egypt that benefit 27 million people. Conservation work at some 70 sites throughout the country has included groundwater lowering at the Giza Plateau, protecting the Sphinx and other internationally and historically significant cultural treasures. Further, over the past three years, we have added 40,000 new jobs to the market.

USAID programs are designed in coordination with Egyptians to create sustainable prosperity. Programs seek to improve agricultural and water productivity and enhance livelihoods in rural zones where poverty and lack of jobs, especially for youth and women, are issues. USAID helps to ensure that future generations will have the tools to succeed and provides opportunities for Egypt’s large youth population as it enters higher education and the workforce. We seek to enhance the contributions of civil society as a whole – with a focus on women and youth – to build institutions and to achieve political and economic reforms.

Our program in Egypt, totaling nearly $30 billion since 1975, has directly and fundamentally supported concrete achievements that have improved the lives of and futures of Egyptians.

 
We have helped to eliminate polio and significantly reduce infant and maternal mortality rates. There are libraries in all 39,000 public schools in Egypt due to USAID support, and we are working to ensure that all children learn to read in the first grade. We improved and expanded telecommunications networks, which was critical to Egypt’s ability to increase trade and investment. In greater Cairo, we supported the reduction of lead levels in the air by more than 65 percent. We helped to decentralize the water and sanitation sector and have improved water and wastewater facilities in Greater Cairo, the North Coast, and Upper Egypt that benefit 27 million people. Conservation work at some 70 sites throughout the country has included groundwater lowering at the Giza Plateau, protecting the Sphinx and other internationally and historically significant cultural treasures. Further, over the past three years, we have added 40,000 new jobs to the market.

1.) Education
The goal of the Teacher Empowerment for Student Success (TESS) Project is for Thai students to have the communication skills in English necessary to improve their personal, academic, and professional development. The project works in rural and under-served schools and communities in all regions of the country. Volunteers support improved English teaching through a co-teaching model, working closely with Thai teachers to plan and teach daily English lessons as well as foster a student-centered environment. In addition to working at school, Volunteers also engage with their local communities to engage them in the students’ education and organize other community development projects.

2.)Youth in Development
The overall goal of the Youth in Development Project is to help Thai youth develop the skills and attributes that prepare them to be healthy engaged citizens who contribute positively to their communities. Volunteers work in the rural regions of Thailand in partnership with local government offices, schools, and health centers. Volunteers engage in community needs assessment and develop projects around two key goals- cultivating life skills and leadership and promoting healthy lifestyles. Volunteers reach youth through a combination of classes, clubs, community projects and youth camps that engage local teachers and officials as co-facilitators but also engage the youth themselves to be leaders.",[]

The agency also advises the Secretary of Commerce and the President of the United States on intellectual property (IP) policy. The USPTO develops and implements education and outreach programs dedicated to promoting awareness of IP, including awareness of the creation of IP as well as the enforcement of IP rights at all‐levels. The Office of Education (OE), which resides within the Office of the Chief Communications Officer of the USPTO, has a mission to increase IP awareness and knowledge through education, outreach, and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) play a significant role in the USPTO’s K‐20 education and outreach programming because STEM is vital to invention, innovation, and the development of a future USPTO workforce. Integration of STEM knowledge, especially as it relates to IP, is also vital to the development of a future stakeholder base for the USPTO, i.e., inventors, innovators, and creators who will file better and higher quality patent and trademark applications based on their attained knowledge of IP. The programs are unique and designed to strategically reach a broad cross section of the population including, women and under‐represented and traditionally underserved groups.",[]

To engage Mandarin-speaking viewers between the age of 15-34 with high quality content and experiences. To grow subscribers on all platforms as we’re constantly brainstorming on social media strategies and content ideas to ensure growth. 

Background:
Chinese views of the United States are changing—and changing fast. As one headline in the New York Times put it last year: “To many Chinese, America was like ‘heaven.’ Now they’re not so sure.” Increasingly, the Chinese see America as a strategic rival that has, at least according to government propaganda, been trying to keep them down. 

As the same Times article concedes, affection for America still runs deep. Many continue to draw inspiration from the idea of the American dream. That’s especially true among Gen Z and Millennial Chinese.  Sixty percent of those between the ages of 15 and 34 have a favorable view of the U.S., and they’re almost 40% more likely to be interested in U.S. news. And to reach that audience, Voice of America has launched a new, digital video brand aimed at telling America’s story and how it relates to them: +1, or Jia Yi in Mandarin—because it’s the first thing you have to dial to call America from anywhere in the world.

We are younger Mandarin speakers’ window into American life, culture, and current events. We aim to create content they want to see and will be on platforms they’re already on. We’re data-driven. And we’ll be nimble and quick. We are built from the ground up for this audience, by this audience.

The potential is huge and our mission is vital: There are some 133 million Chinese worldwide between the ages of 15 and 34 with access to the internet beyond China’s great firewall. And while VOA’s current Mandarin service already reaches some 60 million people, their viewers are older and more established. We need to reach the next generation, who will soon be growing up to take their place. The audience Plus One is after is the next generation of influencers, decision makers, and thought leaders. To reach them, our content runs the gamut from the serious and important (“Explaining the First Amendment"") to the fun and informal (“What is a Gender Reveal Party and Why is it Popular in America?”)

With Chinese state-sponsored misinformation on the rise, VOA’s mandate to provide comprehensive coverage and telling our audience the truth has never been more important. This audience—the future decision-makers and thought leaders of China—wants to know the truth about America. They want to know about our country and culture and how it relates to them. Plus One will be their source.",[]

The National Science Board (NSB) recommends and encourages the pursuit of national policies for the promotion of research and education in science and engineering.

The NSB has two important roles. First, it establishes the policies of National Science Foundation (NSF) within the framework of applicable national policies set forth by the President and the Congress. In this capacity, the Board identifies issues that are critical to NSF's future, approves NSF's strategic budget directions and the annual budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget, and approves new major programs and awards. The second role of the Board is to serve as an independent body of advisors to both the President and the Congress on policy matters related to science and engineering and education in science and engineering. In addition to major reports, the NSB also publishes occasional policy papers or statements on issues of importance to U.S. science and engineering. 

The NSB is made up of 25 Members appointed by the President. The NSF Director is an ex officio Member. Members serve six-year terms. With the exception of the NSF Director, one-third of the Board is appointed every two years. NSB Members are drawn from industry and universities, and represent a variety of science and engineering disciplines and geographic areas. The NSB is apolitical. The NSF Act of 1950, as amended, states that nominees to the ""Board (1) shall be eminent in the fields of the basic, medical, or social sciences, engineering, agriculture, education, research management or public affairs; (2) shall be selected solely on the basis of established records of distinguished service; and (3) shall be so selected as to provide representation of the views of scientific and engineering leaders in all areas of the Nation.""​ The NSB elects its own Chairman and Vice Chairman. The Chairman, in turn, is authorized to make appointments to the NSB staff. The NSB Office is headed by the Board Executive Officer.",[]

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE COMMENT POLICY
If you wish to comment, use the text box. The Department of the Air Force reserves the right to modify this policy at any time.
This is a moderated forum. That means all comments will be reviewed. In addition, we expect that participants will treat each other, as well as our agency and our employees, with respect.
We will not allow comments that contain abusive or vulgar language, hate speech, personal attacks, comments that violate equal employment opportunity policy or are offensive to others, or similar content to remain.

We will not allow comments that are spam, are clearly “off-topic,” promote services or products, infringe on copyright-protected material, or contain links that do not contribute to the discussion to remain. Comments that make unsupported accusations will not be allowed.
The Air Force alone will determine which comment will be posted. Any references to commercial entities, products, services, or other non-governmental organizations or individuals that remain on the site are provided solely for the information of individuals using this page.
These references are not intended to reflect the opinion of the Department of the Air Force, Department of Defense, the U.S. or their employees concerning the significance, priority, or importance to be given the referenced entity, product, service or organization. Such references are not an official or personal endorsement of any product, person or service, and may not be quoted or reproduced for the purpose of stating or implying Department of the Air Force endorsement or approval of any product, person or service.
Any comments that report criminal activity, including suicidal behavior or sexual assault, will be reported to the appropriate authorities, including the Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

Do not use this forum to:
- Report criminal activity. If you have information for law enforcement, please contact Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or your local police agency.
- Submit unsolicited proposals or other business ideas or inquiries. This site is not to be used for contracting or commercial business.
- Submit any claim, demand, informal or formal complaint, or any other form of legal and or administrative notice or process, or for the exhaustion of any legal and or administrative remedy.

We recognize that the web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. However, given the need to manage federal resources, moderating and posting of comments will occur at a time determined by the PA office. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends will be reviewed as early as possible; in most cases, this means the next business day.

For the benefit of robust discussion, we ask that comments remain “on-topic.” The views expressed on the site by non-federal commentators do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Department of the Air Force or the federal government.

The 515 AMOG controls, loads, unloads, and repairs Western Pacific en-route mobility aircraft, whether military, commercial, or foreign to keep the mission moving with precise, reliable VELOCITY!

Three Air Mobility Squadrons (AMS) fall under the 515 AMOG: 730 AMS, Yokota AB, Japan; 731 AMS Osan, South Korea; and 733 AMS, Kadena AB, Japan. In addition to these units, the group is also responsible for air mobility operations throughout the western pacific encompassing over 890+ military, US and host nation civilians.

Over the past few years, the group has overseen a vast array of airlift operations to include humanitarian relief to earthquake victims in China and tsunami relief in American Samoa. Additionally, it has provided vital support to such diplomatic events as the G-8 summit and President Obama's first and subsequent visits to the Asian theater. As a critical element of America's power projection capability the group has also played an essential role supporting the nation's ongoing war on terrorism with 24/7 Air Mobility Support for the Warfighter and Joint Community.
The tremendous efforts of the 515 AMOG earned its first Outstanding Unit Award streamer as key member of the 18th Air Force team.
The 730 AMS (Yokota Air Base, Japan) / 731 AMS (Osan Air Base, S.

OITE's mission is to enhance the training experience of students and fellows on all the NIH campuses (as well as students unaffiliated with NIH). OITE works closely with the Training Offices in the NIH Institutes and Centers to help trainees in the Intramural Research Program (IRP) develop scientific and professional skills that will enable them to become leaders in the biomedical research community. 

The NIH OITE YouTube channel provides ample resources regarding academic guidance and personal/professional development for aspiring, young, and seasoned scientists alike. Through publishing previously recorded lectures, interactive panel discussions, and other virtual events organized by OITE, the NIH OITE YouTube channel proves a significant source of information for any student pursuing the biomedical sciences.

A few examples within the broad range of topics that the NIH OITE YouTube channel has to offer its viewers are as follows:

How to prepare for graduate or medical school, how to navigate work/school life professionally, how to improve characteristics that make students more competitive for future opportunities, how to prepare for running your own lab in the future, how to manage professional relationships, how to recognize and manage the challenges that accompany poor mental health and wellbeing (specifically for scientists), and how to intentionally and carefully hone skills that will contribute positively to career development.",[]

Kennedy challenged students at the University of Michigan to serve their country in the cause of peace by living and working in developing countries. From that inspiration grew an agency of the federal government devoted to world peace and friendship.
Since that time, more than 240,000 Americans of all ages have responded to Kennedy’s call to serve and have helped communities in 161 countries to work on issues ranging from AIDS education to information technology and environmental preservation.
Today's Peace Corps is more vital than ever, working in emerging and essential areas such as information technology and business development, and contributing to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Peace Corps Volunteers continue to support countless individuals who want to build a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities.
