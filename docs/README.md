# Touchpoints Product Documentation

Touchpoints product documentation is loosely based on the `The Product Cycle`, which embraces living documentation, and the concept of blueprints as a shared abstraction to design and discuss product decisions.

* [Personas](PERSONAS.md)
* [Use Cases](USE_CASES.md)
* Concept Inventory Data Model
* Lightweight design sketches
* Pixel-level design, on-brand, with interactions
* [Working Software](https://touchpoints-staging.app.cloud.gov)

In practice, to gauge whether these artifacts are valuable, ask:

1. do they facilitate higher order conversations?
1. do they allow for the capturing of product thought? (from broad-vision, to detailed product copy change)
1. does it serve as a map? _providing context AND driving action?_
1. are they easy to update?
