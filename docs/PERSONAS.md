# Personas

A Persona represents a general category of user,
based on the user's behaviors and needs.
Often, Personas are "brought-to-life" via real-world examples, pictures, interviews.
Generally, Personas are a place to hang information related to user needs.

* System Administrator - can manage all aspects of Touchpoints
* .gov Webmaster - User who manages an Organization's Touchpoints
* Service Manager - User who `owns` one or more Services, Containers, and Touchpoints
* Public users - a non logged-in public user who uses a .gov website to access and or complete a Touchpoint for a Service

#### How do Personas map to Roles & Permissions?

* Admin has `admin` privileges
* Webmaster & Service Manager can login and do not have `admin` privileges
* Public users do not login
