279,BARD mobile,The BARD Mobile app provides access to braille and talking books directly from the NLS Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD). ,"A service of the National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS), Library of Congress

The BARD Mobile app provides access to braille and talking books directly from the NLS Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD). BARD contains nearly 50,000 books, magazines, and music scores in audio and braille formats, with new selections added daily.

With BARD Mobile, you can play the audio materials on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. If your device is connected to a refreshable braille display through Bluetooth, you can also read the braille materials available on BARD.

Before you can use this BARD Mobile app, you must be registered with a braille and talking-book library in the NLS network of cooperating libraries. If you aren’t registered but think you qualify for this service because you cannot read regular print as a result of a visual or physical disability, locate your local library for the blind and physically handicapped at http://www.loc.gov/nls/find.html or call 1-800-NLS-READ to apply for service. 

Once you have an account, you are ready to begin using BARD Mobile. 

Download the free app and sign in with your BARD user name and password. You’ll only need to do this the first time you use the app. The app contains a user manual that you may access through the Help feature.

The National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS), Library of Congress, administers the braille and talking-book program, a free library service available to residents of the United States and its territories and American citizens living abroad whose low vision, blindness, or physical disability makes reading regular print difficult. Through its national network of cooperating libraries, NLS mails digital audio players and books and magazines—in audio and in braille—directly to enrollees at no cost. Music instructional materials are available in large-print, braille, and recorded formats. Select materials are also available online for download.","",English,"[{""id""=>861, ""name""=>""Library of Congress (LOC)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.libraryofcongress.gov""}]","[{""id""=>2051, ""tag_text""=>""utilities""}, {""id""=>4007, ""tag_text""=>""books""}, {""id""=>1271, ""tag_text""=>""reference""}, {""id""=>2271, ""tag_text""=>""disabled veterans""}, {""id""=>4931, ""tag_text""=>""disabled""}, {""id""=>4921, ""tag_text""=>""disability""}, {""id""=>4831, ""tag_text""=>""handicapped""}, {""id""=>3493, ""tag_text""=>""library of congress""}, {""id""=>1995, ""tag_text""=>""library""}, {""id""=>4911, ""tag_text""=>""recordings""}, {""id""=>4821, ""tag_text""=>""blind""}, {""id""=>4901, ""tag_text""=>""visually impaired""}]","[{""store_url""=>""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bard-mobile/id705229586?mt=8"", ""platform""=>""iOS"", ""version_number""=>""1.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2013-09-19T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>""http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e2/74/98/e274989b-7261-b3b6-5a9a-917bc97c2415/screen568x568.jpeg\r\nhttp://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d5/ae/a4/d5aea4fd-75ed-76da-b5d1-be3f95cc5858/screen568x568.jpeg\r\nhttp://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2c/63/88/2c638882-fc3b-2b37-e336-c220af004907/screen568x568.jpeg\r\nhttp://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/b0/70/2e/b0702e86-0289-97a2-0d93-f8927ee0dfd1/screen568x568.jpeg\r\nhttp://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/f0/90/c3/f090c32b-f8d5-ca41-e78b-3287f2530a1d/screen568x568.jpeg"", ""device""=>""App - Phone/Tablet"", ""average_rating""=>""4.0"", ""number_of_ratings""=>108}, {""store_url""=>""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.loc.nls.dtb"", ""platform""=>""Android"", ""version_number""=>""1.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>"""", ""device""=>""App - Phone/Tablet"", ""average_rating""=>"""", ""number_of_ratings""=>nil}]",2015-12-14T21:04:13.000Z,2020-03-22T00:49:02.000Z

9259,B4UFLY,B4UFLY provides UAS/drone operators awareness to determine if it is safe to fly.,"B4UFLY is an FAA Mobile Application for iOS and Android that provides a small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) aircraft operator the ability to check their current location for conformance with FAA published guidelines prior to flight operations. 

The B4UFLY app provides model aircraft users with situational awareness and considers the user’s current or planned location in relation to operational restrictions to derive a specific status indicator.  The color and shape coded status indicators inform the user if model aircraft operation is prohibited, requires the user to take certain actions, or if there are no FAA operating restrictions other than flying safely. All model aircraft operations must always yield the right-of-way to manned aircraft.

The second segment, the product code, identifies the drug, including the specific strength, dosage form, and formulation. The third segment, the package code, identifies package sizes and types. The firm assigns the product and package codes. 

All drugs entering U.S. commercial distribution are required to be listed with the FDA.

Each Toolbox Talk includes a quote from a mine worker to demonstrate a first person experience with a hazard or risk. This first person experience is then linked to MSHA injury data to show that these experiences are consistent with the realities of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Finally, several questions are included that can be used to start a discussion about a specific Toolbox Talk topic - for instance, questions for the slips and falls topic are focused on having mine workers identify where slips and falls are likely to occur at their mine site and ways mine workers can protect themselves from slip and fall injuries.

8972,S1 Mobile Mapper for Android,"Capture & synchronize offline geospatial field data edits to enterprise GIS databases as well as download & display map content using ESRI ArcGIS for Organization accounts, for use by participating US federal agencies.","The S1 Mobile application is a custom mapping and field data collection application built by the Service First (S1) Mobile GIS team, sponsored by Oregon State Office Bureau of Land Management and Region 6 US Forest Service. It is designed to extend offline mobile field data collection capabilities not available using commercial ESRI mapping applications and to meet the specific data collection needs of the federal agencies served by the OR/WA Service First Mobile GIS program. The application leverages each agency’s ArcGIS for Organization (AG4O) site as well as their internal ArcGIS Server deployments to distribute, collect and update enterprise geographic information systems (GIS) information by agency field personnel.
  
Because agency field personnel operate most commonly in remote areas with no network access, this application’s emphasis is on the display, collection & update of geospatial data and attributes with minimal network availability. Data is downloaded and cached on device, edits can then be uploaded to servers when network connectivity is available & it is most convenient for field personnel.

8871,Hawaiian Scarab ID,"a mobile app that allows identification of native and invasive scarab and stag beetles in Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific","



The megadiverse Scarabaeoidea (scarabs, stags, and bess beetles) consists of over 31,000 species that are distributed worldwide and includes many important agricultural pests, agents of biological control of dung and dung flies, important pollinators, and species used as habitat bioindicators (Jameson and Ratcliffe, 2002; Ratcliffe, et al., 2002). Despite their ecological, evolutionary, and economic significance, there is an overwhelming lack of expertise on these insects. The lack of knowledge is of concern because many species are invasive agricultural and economic pests. Conservation of native scarabs and the conservation impact of non-native scarabs is an additional concern. Once established, scarab pests are extremely difficult to dislodge, and a full range of technologies and controls is needed for their eradication (Jackson and Klein, 2006).
This key allows you to easily identify adult and immature scarab beetles including established pest species and potential new invasive scarab species. The key includes scarab beetles that are of biosecurity risk, such as the Chinese rose beetle (Adoretus sinicus) and the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), as well as scarab beetles that are beneficial recyclers of cattle dung, such as the gazelle dung beetle (Digitonthophagus gazella) and tumble bugs. The scarab and stag beetle fauna of Hawaii is of global origin, with non-native species hailing from Australia, Africa, North America, Asia, and Europe. Only five stag beetles are native to Hawaii, and these are greatly in need of conservation and study. Guam is a key introduction pathway for many species that have been introduced to Hawaii. This tool may also be useful in other geographic regions that may be impacted by invasive scarab beetles, including Florida, California, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and the American Pacific. It is designed for people with varying degrees of knowledge, from outdoor enthusiasts to research scientists.

361,FoodKeeper,The FoodKeeper contains storage advice to help maintain the quality of food.,"The FoodKeeper can help consumers use food while at peak quality and reduce waste. The storage times listed are intended as useful guidelines and are not hard-and-fast rules. Some foods may deteriorate more quickly while others may last longer than the times suggested. The times will vary depending on the growing conditions, harvesting techniques, manufacturing processes, transportation and distribution conditions, nature of the food, and storage temperatures. Remember to buy foods in reasonable quantities and rotate the products in your pantry, refrigerator, and freezer. 

Every year, billions of pounds of good food go to waste in the U.S. because consumers are not sure of its quality or safety. Food waste from households represents about 44% of all food waste generated in the U.S. By reducing food waste through buying appropriate quantities, storing foods properly, cooking what is needed and composting, consumers can save money and reduce the amount of food going to landfills.",https://lh6.ggpht.com/gJcyTh0oRyOC75ktcRHc9yZGN0KenqugmAzAjZaW5577TmgWCa5ioXD2brdoO-zA6T-a=w300-rw,English,"[{""id""=>1771, ""name""=>""Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/""}]",[],"[{""store_url""=>""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.usda.fsis.foodkeeper"", ""platform""=>""Android"", ""version_number""=>""5.0.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2015-03-31T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>"""", ""device""=>""App - Phone/Tablet"", ""average_rating""=>""4.3"", ""number_of_ratings""=>38}, {""store_url""=>""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/usda-foodkeeper/id978186100?mt=8"", ""platform""=>""iOS"", ""version_number""=>""5.0.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>""http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/d3/72/cc/d372cc94-625c-1ba0-bd3b-c5e3c0f56959/screen1136x1136.jpeg"", ""device""=>""App - Phone/Tablet"", ""average_rating""=>""4+"", ""number_of_ratings""=>35}]",2015-12-14T21:04:18.000Z,2017-02-06T19:59:40.000Z

8998,AlcoholFX,"AlcoholFX (Alcohol's Effects on the Brain) is a free, science-based app for tablets that teaches students ages 10–12 how alcohol can harm their brains if they drink.","<p>Alcohol’s Effects on the Brain: A Reach Out Now Mobile Application is a science-based curriculum for fifth- and sixth-grade classroom use. Developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, this interactive mobile application is divided into six units. Each unit describes the function of one of six parts of the brain and ways in which alcohol use can disrupt this function. Each unit also provides facts related to underage alcohol use that will be of interest to this age group.</p>Four of the six units feature a narrated scenario that enables students to consider how they might respond to a situation involving alcohol use. Students can video-record their responses individually or as a team. Teachers can have the students replay their responses, now combined with the scenario, for class discussion. Alternatively, teachers may ask students to describe their responses to the scenario in a writing assignment. The remaining two units feature a card-matching game and a word scramble, both of which reinforce the content in those units.<p>Students who complete all six units are rewarded with access to the Brain Snatchers game. Teacher materials include a discussion guide with key concepts, objectives, and questions; suggested cross-curricular use of the app's content; and a list of resources related to underage alcohol use. Content is presented in both print and audio to make this app accessible to all students.</p>",http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/e2/52/7e/e2527ea9-74ed-a1fa-9cab-fd1514564e74/source/350x350bb.jpg,English,"[{""id""=>2271, ""name""=>""Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.samhsa.gov/""}, {""id""=>361, ""name""=>""Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.hhs.gov""}]","[{""id""=>13461, ""tag_text""=>""underage drinking""}, {""id""=>26431, ""tag_text""=>""alcohol""}, {""id""=>401, ""tag_text""=>""education""}, {""id""=>1441, ""tag_text""=>""teachers""}, {""id""=>3172, ""tag_text""=>""child health""}, {""id""=>3791, ""tag_text""=>""children and youth""}, {""id""=>1221, ""tag_text""=>""public health""}, {""id""=>2051, ""tag_text""=>""utilities""}]","[{""store_url""=>""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alcohols-effects-on-brain/id992971998?mt=8"", ""platform""=>""iOS"", ""version_number""=>""1.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2016-01-11T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>""http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/1a/4b/c3/1a4bc360-22d2-579e-8f6c-05a73a4c004a/screen480x480.jpeg\r\nhttp://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/57/93/80/579380c6-522c-8170-de0c-c7ec73afe464/screen480x480.jpeg\r\nhttp://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/a1/e8/21/a1e821af-3d82-ff6e-a7d7-967dcb92ea67/screen480x480.jpeg\r\nhttp://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/5a/f1/0f/5af10fa0-3d34-2785-1ee8-b5238a19e4d8/screen480x480.jpeg\r\nhttp://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/e1/8e/64/e18e6400-20dd-15e8-7010-b3d465c229df/screen480x480.jpeg"", ""device""=>""App - Tablet Only"", ""average_rating""=>"""", ""number_of_ratings""=>nil}, {""store_url""=>""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.samhsa.alcoholfx"", ""platform""=>""Android"", ""version_number""=>""1.0"", ""publish_date""=>""2016-01-11T00:00:00.000Z"", ""screenshot""=>""//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qifVALm2DOSROkWlCdUan2jb8BeViKeRIGnYvA8w3MEOQZ-IO6_TO-OR5yppknj2ZsmI=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BJ2RogodY5QMVGa9LLNl98n5yPKZ7K9jIsD8yLD5weOLAdTp_tj-kgFPxi0cF6Kn8SA=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rffnLauMWAzDI3PgZkGYcmpXJcBvXsaCqybgH__qe5uaya_6aLfDJHd72nIJOjYbAo4=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/6OcIkCy5U2IqeRpk993IzRgNT5lp2OQXD427rQ-QVsiMtYFpCIPJ7o7owLygnRmU_iQ=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/1wN4CRDrFtZFdojfg7Va25B7hFtZDBq47rKKkF7NYKC_O5Y5fKpcwN-5ZnFwd9FfN2M=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/T-rnkwvRZfh0mIq2ivCDZfgz6jDQIppbjggfcBHQKA8ES7rzenUz4uP_nkOGLbMio30=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/U5ZFZ54PiOeQBSOQw-5FaRns1C41awUQ_QXRn8XCc81S8iwTzWYZuZWptd_SXOrbU2w=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/LOmOzDQuFlwrzve-lb6bNXl8iKpG4oZvuNrBgW_uVy2s5QnITkr3pwrZMcldvBbxdA=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Sx3Geba3xt5V3xYm17pH9ga9n_S2D1tYaic7pSD6fRIUswtJTxwDfiMramDkudr5rgsy=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/vCWvIN6YsEYpfAKKsH82eI5CC27MCaXbpn73LoxDMk9PSOlx82XEhqs3btQZ90i_wJQ=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P8JIswJsthTeqmr7P1NH7RdK9b_0wFDAln80HYGMaFT5XyzoBvxCsGkrHPgRuIOwKK5r=h310\r\n//lh3.googleusercontent.com/cFhjL9iy40cBKqjgypH28W97JP5tpK0QvU8u6uxE8dSN4rLY6_kJrdDWzG268utBnw8=h310"", ""device""=>""App - Tablet Only"", ""average_rating""=>""5"", ""number_of_ratings""=>1}]",2017-01-26T01:50:30.000Z,2017-01-26T03:39:54.000Z
