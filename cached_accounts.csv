218380,Veterans Benefits Administration,vavetbenefits,youtube,Official account of the Veterans Benefits Administration,"As one of three administrations within VA, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration and the National Cemetery Administration, provides benefits and services to Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has been undergoing a major transformation that is people-centric, results-oriented, and a forward-looking integration of solutions that will ensure total lifelong engagement with Servicemembers, Veterans, their families and survivors.

Within VBA, there are three Deputy Under Secretaries led by the Under Secretary for Benefits. Their organizations provide oversight for Disability Assistance, Economic Opportunity, and Field Operations. Additionally, there are four program offices including Strategic Planning, Management, Resource Management and Performance Analysis and Integrity.

To help you better understand the services VBA offers, a brief summary of some the offices that directly support benefit delivery is as follows:

There are four business lines under the Office of Disability Assistance:
Compensation Service: Oversees the delivery of disability compensation to Veterans disabled by an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active military service.
Pension and Fiduciary Service: Provides program oversight that helps wartime Veterans, their families, and survivors with financial challenges by providing supplemental income through Veterans Pension, Death Pension, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.
Insurance Service: Maintains life insurance programs that give financial security and peace of mind for Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families.
Benefits Assistance Service: Facilitates Client Services and Outreach, Web Communications, and ensures Quality and Training for VBA employees who engage Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families through services such as the National Call Center.

Under the Office of Economic Opportunity, there are three business lines:
Education Service: Administers VA's education programs that provide education and training benefits to eligible Servicemembers, Veterans, and dependents.
Loan Guaranty Service: Provides oversight of the VA Guaranteed Home Loan Program that guarantees home loans in varying amounts. Ensures Veteran's rights are protected when purchasing a home under this program.
Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E) Service: Oversees programs that provide employment and independent living services including vocational counseling, job search assistance, and post-secondary training.

The Office of Field Operations is organized as follows:
Four area offices: Eastern Area, Detroit, MI; Southern Area, Nashville, TN; Central Area, Muskogee, OK; Western Area, Phoenix, AZ
Regional Offices: Under the Area Offices, there are 56 regional offices (ROs) within the United States. There is also an RO in Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
Records Management Center: Houses most service treatment records forwarded by the Department of Defense to VA.
Appeals Management Center: Processes most appeals that have been returned to VBA by the Board of Veterans Appeals.

The Office of Strategic Planning, provides oversight of VBA's Transformation through the following offices:

Under this system of protection, American industry has flourished. New products have been invented, new uses for old ones discovered, and employment opportunities created for millions of Americans.

A top priority of the IACB is the implementation and enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (Act), a truth-in-advertising law that provides criminal and civil penalties for marketing products as ""Indian-made"" when such products are not made by Indians, as defined by the Act.","The Indian Arts and Crafts Board (IACB), U.S. Department of the Interior, was created by Congress to promote the economic development of federally recognized* American Indians and Alaska Natives (Indians) through the expansion of the Indian arts and crafts market.  A top priority of the IACB is the implementation and enforcement of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (Act), a truth-in-advertising law that provides criminal and civil penalties for marketing products as ""Indian-made"" when such products are not made by Indians, as defined by the Act.

The IACB's other activities include providing professional business advice, information on the Act and related marketing issues, fundraising assistance, and promotional opportunities to Indian artists, craftspeople, and cultural organizations of federally recognized tribes.  The IACB operates three regional museums in the Plains Region, the Sioux Indian Museum, the Museum of the Plains Indian, and the Southern Plains Indian Museum.  The IACB also produces a consumer directory of approximately 400 federally recognized Indian owned and operated arts and crafts businesses.

These activities are not duplicated in either the federal or private sector.  The IACB is the only federal agency that is consistently and exclusively concerned with the economic benefits and cultural development of federally recognized Indians.  The IACB's policies are determined by Commissioners who are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, and serve without compensation.  The IACB's activities and programs are carried out by a professional and experienced staff.

* The IACB provides services, including Source Directory listings, to enrolled members of ""any Indian tribe, band, nation, or Alaska Native village, or other organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians""  (25 U.S.C. § 305e(d)(3)(A)).  The Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. §§ 479a(2), 479a-1, requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish a list of all Indian or Alaska Native tribes, bands, nations, pueblos, villages or communities ""recognize[d] to be eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.""  Consistent with other statutes defining this Department's responsibilities and obligations to Indian tribes, the Department interprets the first definition of Indian tribe in the Indian Arts and Crafts Act as those tribes listed on the tribal entities list published in the Federal Register.

IHS offers clinicians extraordinary opportunities for providing comprehensive care to a medically underserved patient population within culturally diverse Native communities. IHS clinicians live and practice in some of the most spectacular Areas of the country, in rural locations where there is great demand for generalists in clinical settings, as well as for specialists in hospital settings. IHS offers three employment options: Clinicians can join IHS as federal civil service employees, as direct Tribal/Urban Indian hires or as officers of the US Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps. Each path offers generous vacation, sick leave, benefit and retirement packages, as well as possibilities for sign-up bonuses. Clinicians are also eligible to apply for the IHS Loan Repayment Program, which repays eligible health profession education loans — up to $20,000 per year — for a two-year service commitment at an eligible site within their health profession discipline.

Once common throughout the eastern and southcentral United States, red wolf populations were decimated by the early part of the 20th Century as a result of intensive predator control programs and the degradation and alteration of the species' habitat. The red wolf was designated an endangered species in 1967, and shortly thereafter the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated efforts to conserve the species. Today, more than 100 red wolves roam their native habitats in eastern North Carolina, and nearly 200 red wolves are maintained in captive breeding facilities throughout the United States.",Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/redwolfrecoveryprogram,English,"[{""id""=>1741, ""name""=>""Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.fws.gov/""}]",[],2020-09-04T21:58:19.000Z,2020-09-05T03:38:49.000Z

201221,Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge,tennesseenwr,facebook,"Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing more than 51,000 acres, is located on Kentucky Lake in northwest Tennessee.","Containing over 51,000 acres of water, forests, farmland and grasslands, this refuge is located on and around Kentucky Lake in Northwest Tennessee. The refuge’s three units, Big Sandy, Duck River, and Busseltown, stretch for 65 miles along the Tennessee River. Established in 1945, the refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge provides a major wintering area for migrating waterfowl. Currently the refuge habitats include agricultural crops; natural plants that grown in moist soil conditions, vegetated wetlands, and forest lands. The resulting combination of agricultural grains, natural foods and protected areas sustains waterfowl through the winter months. The refuge also provides habitat for resident wildlife species and other migratory birds. The refuge’s diversity of habitats also supports breeding, wintering and migration habitat for 301 bird species and habitat for 51 mammals, 89 reptiles and amphibians and 144 species of fish. White-tailed deer can be found throughout the area, along with smaller animals such as raccoons, foxes, squirrels, beaver, rabbits and wild turkey. In addition to being a home to wildlife, the refuge offers many recreational opportunities such as: hunting, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, and photography. The refuge offers three hiking trails, four wildlife observation decks, multiple boat ramps and fishing decks. The refuge also provides the perfect outdoor classroom for environmental education and interpretation activities. Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge is open during daylight hours.

218651,NOAA B-WET,noaabwet,facebook,NOAA Education B-WET is an environmental education competitive grant program that promotes experiential learning in the K-12 environment through Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences.,"NOAA Bay-Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) is an environmental education program that promotes locally relevant, experiential learning in the K-12 environment. The primary delivery of B-WET is through competitive funding that promotes Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences (MWEEs). B-WET currently serves seven areas of the country: California, Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Hawai'i, New England, and the Pacific Northwest. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is an agency in the Department of Commerce with the mission: “To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources” (noaa.gov) NOAA recognizes that knowledge and commitment built from firsthand experience, especially in the context of one's community and culture, is essential for achieving environmental stewardship. Carefully selected experiences driven by rigorous academic learning standards, engendering discovery and wonder, and nurturing a sense of community will further connect students with their watershed, help reinforce an ethic of responsible citizenship, and promote academic achievement. B-WET maintains relevance by responding to regional education and environmental priorities through local implementation. Please refer to the regional funding opportunity announcements for specific priorities.

These water projects led to homesteading and promoted the economic development of the West. Reclamation has constructed more than 600 dams and reservoirs including Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and Grand Coulee on the Columbia River.

Today, we are the largest wholesaler of water in the country. We bring water to more than 31 million people, and provide one out of five Western farmers (140,000) with irrigation water for 10 million acres of farmland that produce 60% of the nation's vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts.

Mission: The mission of the USDA Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation’s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. 
The Forest Service motto, ""Caring for the Land and Serving People,"" captures the spirit of our mission, which we accomplish through five main activities:
Protection and management of natural resources on National Forest System lands.
Research on all aspects of forestry, rangeland management, and forest resource utilization.
Community assistance and cooperation with State and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners to help protect and manage non-Federal forest and associated range and watershed lands to improve conditions in rural areas.
Achieving and supporting an effective workforce that reflects the full range of diversity of the American people.
International assistance in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources.
The National Forest Foundation, chartered by Congress, engages Americans in community-based and national programs that promote the health and public enjoyment of the 193-million-acre National Forest System, administers private gifts of funds and land for the benefit of the National Forests.
The Forest Service manages a system of 155 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and 222 research and experimental forests, as well as other special areas, covering more than 192 million acres of public land. The Forest Service has evolved into a 30,000 employee agency that manages the national forests for a number of multiple uses, including recreation, timber, wilderness, minerals, water, grazing, fish, and wildlife.

The BIA has changed dramatically over the past 185 years, evolving as Federal policies designed to subjugate and assimilate American Indians and Alaska Natives have changed to policies that promote Indian self-determination.

For almost 200 years, dating back to the role it played in negotiating treaty agreements between the United States and tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the BIA has embodied the trust and government-to-government relationships between the U.S. and the Federally recognized tribes. Over the years, the BIA has been involved in the implementation of Federal laws that have directly affected all Americans. The General Allotment Act of 1887 opened tribal lands west of the Mississippi to non-Indian settlers, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted American Indians and Alaska Natives U.S. citizenship and the right to vote, and the New Deal and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 established modern tribal governments. The World War II period of relocation and the post-War termination era of the 1950s led to the activism of the 1960s and 1970s that saw the takeover of the BIA’s headquarters and resulted in the creation of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975.

218414,Court of Indian Offenses for Southern Plains Region,"",facebook,This is the official Facebook page of the Court of Indian Offenses for the Southern Plains Region also known as the CFR Court.,"The first Court of Indian Offenses in the area that was to become the State of Oklahoma was originally established prior to statehood in the Indian Territory in 1886.  The original Court of Indian Offenses was created to provide law enforcement for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache (KCA) reservation.  Several prominent tribal leaders served as judges of the court including Quanah Parker (Comanche), Lone Wolf (Kiowa) and several others.  An Indian police force provided the law enforcement for the KCA, Cheyenne-Arapaho, and other reservations.  Thus, the Court of Indian Offenses pre-dates Oklahoma state courts by several decades. 

After the reservations in Oklahoma were opened by land runs to non-Indian homesteading, and federal Indian policy sought to weaken tribal governments and break up tribal land holdings, the courts over time lost their funding and consequently ceased to function.  With the void in the enforcement of tribal law, the State began to assert its authority over the remaining tribal and allotted Indian lands even though no jurisdiction properly existed.  In recent decades, the Indian tribes have regained the jurisdiction over these lands and have re-established tribal court systems.
The State of Oklahoma once contended that tribal governments had no authority to operate their own justice systems, arguing that the Indian nations had no land remaining under their jurisdictions.  Much confusion arose because many thought that tribes only asserted jurisdiction over “reservation” lands.  Many people in Oklahoma incorrectly assumed that reservations were terminated at statehood.  Recent court decisions have made it clear that tribes assert jurisdiction over all lands that are “Indian country”, including reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments.  These Indian country lands from the basis of tribal jurisdiction today.  Since few Indian tribes had operating judicial systems in place in the late 1970s. When tribal jurisdiction was re-affirmed, the Court of Indian Offenses for the Anadarko Area Tribes was created.  Courts of Indian Offenses are established throughout the U.S. Under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), providing the commonly used name — the “CFR” Court.  Until such time as a particular Indian tribe establishes their own tribal court, the Court of Indian Offenses will act as a tribe’s judicial system.  

When the court was re-established in western Oklahoma in 1979, there were four CFR Courts covering eighteen Indian nations.  A number of tribes have since established their own systems of justice.  Accordingly, the CFR Courts for these tribes have been deactivated.  In 1991, a separate CFR Court system was established for Eastern Oklahoma Region Tribes covering eastern Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

A well-known actor, John Wilkes Booth, desperate to aid the dying Confederacy, stepped into the president's box. Booth's decision to pull the trigger altered the nation's power to reconstruct after the war. Booth escaped into the night as Abraham Lincoln was carried to the Petersen boarding house across the street. It was there that President Lincoln died early the next morning, and became the first American president to be assassinated.

To ameliorate some of the key factors contributing to the preclinical to clinical development gap in AD the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Library have created a publically available data repository, Alzheimer’s Preclinical Efficacy Database, AlzPED.   AlzPED is designed as a web-based portal for housing, sharing and mining of preclinical efficacy data. The data are submitted to AlzPED through a curator and gleaned from at least two sources; 1) the scientific literature; 2) directly from researchers.  AlzPED houses information on preclinical studies including animal models descriptors, key elements of the study design, information related to the therapeutic target and therapeutic agent, principal findings and information related to funding source(s) and financial conflict of interest.  The long term goal for AlzPED is to also serve as a platform for reporting unpublished studies in order to mitigate the publication bias that favors the reporting of positive findings.

Unlike many parks, however, the U.S. Congress legislated that the National Park Service and the park's advisory commission partner with sites owned and operated by state and local governments, private businesses and nonprofit organizations to achieve this goal. The Keweenaw Heritage Sites program, administered by the Keweenaw National Historical Park Advisory Commission, is one aspect of this partnership.
Heritage sites operate independently of the National Park Service. Sites stretch along the length of the Keweenaw Peninsula, from Copper Harbor to south of Ontonagon.
At the Calumet Visitor Center visitors spend anywhere from a half hour to several hours touring the facility. Displayed are hundreds of artifacts, objects, and photos. There is also a visitor information desk where park rangers will answer questions and provide further insight into the exhibits.",Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/KeweenawNHP,English,"[{""id""=>2021, ""name""=>""National Park Service (NPS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.nps.gov""}]","[{""id""=>3768, ""tag_text""=>""nps""}, {""id""=>3767, ""tag_text""=>""national park service""}, {""id""=>14861, ""tag_text""=>""park""}, {""id""=>3499, ""tag_text""=>""parks""}, {""id""=>1261, ""tag_text""=>""recreation""}, {""id""=>17531, ""tag_text""=>""kewemining""}, {""id""=>17541, ""tag_text""=>""keweenaw""}, {""id""=>921, ""tag_text""=>""labor""}, {""id""=>821, ""tag_text""=>""immigration""}, {""id""=>8031, ""tag_text""=>""historic preservation""}]",2016-04-27T00:12:04.000Z,2018-05-29T14:39:20.000Z

172521,Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail,selmatomontgomerynationalhistorictrail,facebook,The official Facebook account of the Selma to Montgomery NHT.,"The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail was established by Congress in 1996 to commemorate the events, people, and route of the 1965 Voting Rights March in Alabama. 

The 54-mile trail follows the historic march by beginning at the Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma and crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge. As they crossed the bridge, the nonviolent marchers were stopped and beaten by law enforcement officers in what came to be known as –Bloody Sunday” on March 7, 1965. Outraged protesters from around the country joined the marchers for a subsequent five-day march that began in Selma on March 21, 1965, this time with state and federal law enforcement protection.

25,000 marchers concluded the historic march in Montgomery on March 25, with many notable speakers addressing the crowd at a concluding rally near the capitol building; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave one of his most famous speeches at the rally. The Voting Rights Act was signed on August 6, 1965.",Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/SelmatoMontgomeryNationalHistoricTrail,English,"[{""id""=>2021, ""name""=>""National Park Service (NPS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.nps.gov""}]","[{""id""=>3768, ""tag_text""=>""nps""}, {""id""=>3767, ""tag_text""=>""national park service""}, {""id""=>14861, ""tag_text""=>""park""}, {""id""=>3499, ""tag_text""=>""parks""}, {""id""=>1261, ""tag_text""=>""recreation""}, {""id""=>21931, ""tag_text""=>""semo""}, {""id""=>21941, ""tag_text""=>""selma is now""}, {""id""=>21951, ""tag_text""=>""marching for freedom""}]",2016-04-27T00:13:11.000Z,2018-05-25T16:59:43.000Z

As early as 2,000 years ago, indigenous groups used Gitchi Onigamiing “the Great Carrying Place” (Grand Portage) to travel from seasonal homes around Lake Superior to regions of better hunting, fishing, and trapping in the protected interior forests. 

Opened in 1951 as Grand Portage National Historic Site, designated a National Monument in 1958, its nearly 710 acres lie entirely within the boundaries of reservation of the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. The Historic site consists of three reconstructed North West Company buildings on their original locations and an Ojibwe Village exhibit. The Historic site is open seasonally from Memorial Day in May to Indigenous Peoples' Day in October.

Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park preserves and interprets key historical sites and events related to the American Civil War and the rich cultural heritage of the Shenandoah Valley. This includes the Battle of Cedar Creek, a decisive October 19, 1864 Union victory, and Belle Grove, the antebellum plantation manor house of Isaac Hite, Jr. (brother-in-law of President James Madison).
 
  
A Partnership Park

Cedar Creek and Belle Grove NHP is a ""partnership park,"" in which the National Park Service works with several Key Partners to create and manage the park and its resources. These Key Partners are all non-profit or governmental organizations and include:

•The National Trust for Historic Preservation
•Belle Grove, Inc.
•Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation
•Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation
•Shenandoah County, Virginia

Cedar Creek and Belle Grove NHP is also a park-in-development, created by Congress in 2002. Although there are over 3,700 acres within the park's authorized boundary, over half of this is still privately owned. Therefore, much of the battlefield is not accessible to the public. Nearly all of the remaining land (approximately 1,400 acres) and buildings are preserved and administered by the Key Partners.

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is the federal agency, a division of the Department of Commerce, responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources and their habitat. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources. To do this, the agency assesses and predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations, and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices. NOAA Fisheries also recovers protected marine species (i.e. whales, turtles), striking a balance with America's economic and recreational opportunities. With the help of the six regional offices and eight management councils, NOAA Fisheries Service works together with communities on a wide variety of fishery management issues, promotes sustainable fisheries, and works to end overfishing, and the decline of species and their habitat.

The NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Regional Office integrates cutting-edge science from the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center into policy and management decision-making. The two arms of the NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands work closely together for the conservation and management of domestic and international marine resources in the largest geographical management area within both NOAA Fisheries and the regional fishery management council system. We are committed to the highest standards of science, customer service, and stewardship of living marine resources within this expansive geographic Pacific Islands region.

Using the best available science for sustainable fisheries and seafood, our vision for this region is to achieve healthy marine ecosystems that provide stability for fishery resources, recovery of threatened and endangered species, and enhanced opportunities for commercial, recreational and cultural activities in the marine environment.

Visitation: We are open from 9 a.m.- 6 p.m. in the summer and 9-5 after Labor Day.

Most of the 250,000 visitors per year come to see the reconstructed Fort Clatsop, home of the Corps of Discovery during the winter of 1805-1806. 

During the summer we offer living history talks on candle making to black powder demonstrations. 

There are plenty of recreational opportunities at the park from hiking trails to kayaking on the Lewis and Clark River. Free paddle tours and guided walks are offered throughout the summer months.

Our most popular hike is the 1.5 mile Netul River Trail. It is a one-way, gentle, down and back trail that is three miles long and follows the Lewis and Clark River.

The preserve protects a nationally significant remnant of the once vast tallgrass prairie and its natural and cultural resources.Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve is a public/private partnership dedicated to preserving and enhancing a nationally significant remnant of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem and the processes that sustain it; preserving and interpreting the cultural resources of the preserve and the heritage associated with the ranch property; and offering opportunities for education, inspiration, and enjoyment through public access to its geological, ecological, scenic, and historical features.",Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/nps.tallgrassprairie,English,"[{""id""=>2021, ""name""=>""National Park Service (NPS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.nps.gov""}]","[{""id""=>3768, ""tag_text""=>""nps""}, {""id""=>3767, ""tag_text""=>""national park service""}, {""id""=>14861, ""tag_text""=>""park""}, {""id""=>3499, ""tag_text""=>""parks""}, {""id""=>1261, ""tag_text""=>""recreation""}, {""id""=>19991, ""tag_text""=>""tapr""}]",2016-04-27T00:12:40.000Z,2018-05-09T20:15:37.000Z

Usually clear, cold, and slow-moving, the river sometimes plunges as a muddy torrent through its rockbound shoals. For centuries people have been drawn to the river for food and transportation and for power to sustain the mills, factories and homes built along its banks. Today the river attracts us for different reasons. People come to float down the river, hike the trails along its banks, play touch football in the meadows, and simply relax.

If you're looking for the official source of information about Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, please visit our homepage at www.nps.gov/chat.","Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area is a series of parklands along a 48-mile stretch of the Chattahoochee River--a place rich in natural and human history, each influenced by the river's pervasive force. Usually clear, cold, and slow-moving, the river sometimes plunges as a muddy torrent through its rockbound shoals. For centuries people have been drawn to the river for food and transportation and for power to sustain the mills, factories and homes built along its banks.

Today the river attracts us for different reasons. People come to float down the river, hike the trails along its banks, play touch football in the meadows, and simply relax. In its role as and outdoor classroom, the park promises to expand your horizons through nature walks exploring its plants and birds and the river.",Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/CRNRA,English,"[{""id""=>2021, ""name""=>""National Park Service (NPS)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.nps.gov""}]","[{""id""=>3768, ""tag_text""=>""nps""}, {""id""=>3767, ""tag_text""=>""national park service""}, {""id""=>14861, ""tag_text""=>""park""}, {""id""=>3499, ""tag_text""=>""parks""}, {""id""=>1261, ""tag_text""=>""recreation""}, {""id""=>13221, ""tag_text""=>""chat""}, {""id""=>20331, ""tag_text""=>""crnra""}]",2016-04-27T00:12:45.000Z,2018-05-08T19:22:15.000Z

The park is composed of three NPS-owned properties: Melrose, the William Johnson House, and the Fort Rosalie site.

The pre-Civil War Melrose estate was built by a wealthy cotton planter.  This Greek Revival mansion is complete with original furnishing and intact outbuildings and has been well-maintained and preserved over the years.

William Johnson, a slave who was freed, started out as a barber and eventually owned several barber shops, rental property, a farm, and timberland; he also kept a lengthy personal and business diary that offers glimpses of antebellum southern life and relations between whites and free blacks.

Established by the French in 1716, Fort Rosalie was built on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, high above the insect-ridden bottomland.

Nearly 100,000 men fell killed or wounded in four battles spanning eighteen months. The constant presence or passage of armies for nearly two years mutilated the landscape, bringing agriculture to a virtual halt. In Fredericksburg, the Union army bombarded and then looted, leaving nearly 100 buildings destroyed and the fortunes of many families ruined. But amidst the destruction, slaves sought and found freedom. The sum total: the Civil War transformed this community socially, physically, and politically.

83851,Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary,GFNMS,facebook,Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary protects the wildlife & habitats of one of the most diverse & bountiful marine environments in the world.,"In 1972, in response to a growing awareness of the value of our coastal waters, Congress passed the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The Act authorized the designation of National Marine Sanctuaries to protect: significant waters and secure habitat for aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing, wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism.

The National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 14 marine protected areas that encompass more than 150,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Florida Keys, and from Lake Huron to American Samoa. The system includes 13 national marine sanctuaries and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.

Designated in 1981, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) spanned 1,279-square-miles (966 square nautical miles) just north and west of San Francisco Bay, and protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, GFNMS expanded north and west of their original boundaries to encompass 3,295 square miles, and changed their name to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. GFNMS has administrative jurisdiction over the northern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz County line northward to the existing boundary between the two sanctuaries. GFNMS maintains an administrative office and public Visitor Center on Crissy Field in the Presidio of San Francisco.

GFNMS is located within the California Current ecosystem, one of four major eastern boundary currents in the world, that stretches along the western coast of North America from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Due to a high degree of wind-driven upwelling, there is a ready supply of nutrients to surface waters and the California Current ecosystem is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world.

GFNMS is a globally significant, extraordinarily diverse, and productive marine ecosystem that supports abundant wildlife and valuable fisheries.

Transparency and open data enable stakeholders and the general public to better understand U.S. foreign assistance investments around the world, make foreign aid more useful for development, and help hold ourselves more accountable.

Since its launch, ForeignAssistance.gov has been working to establish standard data requirements across the U.S. Government, support agencies in quarterly data reporting, and develop a dynamic and user-friendly website. Its mission is to serve as a central repository where stakeholders can easily access and use U.S. Government foreign assistance budget, financial, and award information in a standardized and easy-to-understand format.

ForeignAssistance.gov was created in response to the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and President Obama’s Open Government Initiative.

Introduction: 

Peace Corps Fiji’s social media accounts will promote the goals of Peace Corps. The accounts will raise awareness and increase support to Peace Corps Fiji (PC Fiji) and its activities.

The accounts would be used to: 
•	Recruit prospective Volunteers 
•	Spotlight accomplishments of Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) and the Post’s country program
•	Inform Host Country Nationals (HCNs) of the work of Peace Corps Fiji (PC-Fiji) and program activities
•	Promote local activities and programs relevant to PC Fiji’s work


Audience:

More than 70 percent of Peacecorps.gov’s visitors self-identify as prospective Volunteers.  Our social media content will cater primarily to this audience in addition to current Volunteers, returned Volunteers, family and friends, partner organizations, and HCNs.  This social media presence, while focusing strongly on recruitment messaging, will also seek to reach these additional audiences when creating and posting content, as well as to provide a broader prospective of PC Fiji’s activities.  


Content:

In order to maximize viewership, multiple social media applications will be used.  An ongoing effort will be made to represent the diversity of and within the Agency, Fiji culture and its Volunteers.

211295,USDA Forest Service Alaska Region,58184989@n07,flickr,USFS Region 10,"Alaska contains 17 percent of all U.S. Forest Service lands and contains the two largest forests in the nation. The Tongass National Forest stretches over the 500-mile-long Southeast Alaska Panhandle and covers over 80 percent of that land. The Chugach National Forest makes a 210-mile arc around Prince William Sound.
 
We invite you to explore the nation’s two single largest national forests – the Chugach and Tongass, located in south-central and southeast Alaska. From the Chugach and the famous Russian River of the Kenai Peninsula to the Tongass, which covers most of Southeast Alaska, surrounding the famous Inside Passage, the Alaska Region offers amazing diversity and the most beautiful, famous and stunning forests in the nation.
 
This region offers unique chances to view eagles, bears, spawning salmon and breath-taking vistas of ""wild"" Alaska. As a place for individuals and families to enjoy the outdoors you can take a sled-dog ride on a glacier, hike boardwalk trails, fish in streams or ocean, or just relax at a remote cabin. These special areas offer the ability to escape the crowds of the city and encounter nature at its best.

208098,@EveryKidinaPark,everykidinapark,twitter,A federal initiative to encourage every U.S. 4th grader to explore our great outdoors and history. Follow us on Facebook ,"From the deep seafloor around the Channel Islands to the heights of the Alaska Range, from the Cesar E. Chavez monument in California, to the legacy captured at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington D.C., our federal lands and waters should be experienced and enjoyed by every American, especially our youth. 
To ensure continued preservation so the next generation can experience and enjoy all these places have to offer, we must look to a future generation of stewards who can lead the charge. That is why the Every Kid in a Park Initiative is an effort to inspire every child to get outside and learn about the rich history and culture of our nation and the natural wonders of our federal lands and waters.
The Every Kid in a Park initiative grants every 4th grader in the country and their family, free access to these beautiful places for one full year. 
Our federal lands and waters also serve as an innovative resource educators can use to inspire learning in important subjects like history, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts and can help make teaching and learning fun. Educators interested in taking advantage of this special teaching and learning opportunity can go to the website to access fun and engaging learning activities, aligned to standard.",Twitter,https://twitter.com/everykidinapark?lang=en,English,"[{""id""=>41, ""name""=>""Department of Agriculture (USDA)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.usda.gov""}, {""id""=>411, ""name""=>""Department of the Interior (DOI)"", ""info_url""=>""http://www.doi.gov""}]","[{""id""=>401, ""tag_text""=>""education""}, {""id""=>141, ""tag_text""=>""children""}, {""id""=>2176, ""tag_text""=>""outdoors""}, {""id""=>14501, ""tag_text""=>""outdoor recreation""}, {""id""=>14521, ""tag_text""=>""heritage recreation""}, {""id""=>26538, ""tag_text""=>""recreation pass""}]",2017-02-23T17:07:21.000Z,2017-12-15T14:55:31.000Z

","In 2006 the National Institute of Health (NIH) developed the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) Research Grant Program to foster the research and development of new and improved therapeutics to reduce mortality and morbidity during and/or after civilian chemical emergency events. To date, there has been considerable progress in the areas of target identification, hit and lead development, and preclinical studies. Investigators have identified several molecular entities that show promise as novel targets for therapeutic discovery and development. In vitro and in vivo models for screening are being developed and validated against human and animal efficacy studies. These models have produced several novel compounds with biological activity that is now being tested in proof-of-principle studies with more advanced animal models. There has also been progress in developing new indications for several FDA-approved drugs. Investigators have published over 800 articles in some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals in science, including reports of important discoveries that have implications beyond chemical defense. Over a half dozen compounds have been identified as lead compounds, and several meetings (pre-IND, IND, and NDA) with the FDA have already occurred. One drug is poised for possible FDA approval and government procurement for the SNS very soon.

2. Helping promote a better understanding of Americans on the part of the peoples served.

In August of 1961, Ghana became the first country in the world to receive Peace Corps Volunteers. After nearly 54 years of uninterrupted collaboration, we have roughly 130 Volunteers serving in all 10 regions of the country, at any given time. Our volunteers generally serve in three capacity building sectors: health, education and agriculture. Additionally, the majority of our volunteers work in one or more of the following cross-sector initiatives: HIV/AIDS Awareness & Prevention; Food Security; and Gender & Youth Development.

The goals of Peace Corps Ghana are to promote sustainable development, and to build mutual cultural understanding on the part of Americans and Ghanaians. We achieve these goals by encouraging our volunteers to work with community members to address issues in ways that are sensitive to the cultural values and consistent with the available resources of their communities. Our volunteers supplement host country efforts, they do not serve as a substitute for those efforts. Our volunteers work with an aim of reducing dependency through achievement of developmental goals defined by the Ghanaian government.

We believe that ""development"" is a learning process, in which the people involved are developing skills, know-how, confidence, and the ability to identify and address issues that affect them on a daily basis. Peace Corps Ghana is proud of the role that we have played in Ghana’s development as an independent nation.

Since then, 330 Volunteers have served in 15 of Cambodia’s 24 provinces. All our Volunteers live with host families during pre-service training and throughout their two years of service. Living with a family helps our Volunteers integrate into the communities in which they work, study local culture and traditions, and learn to speak Khmer.

Peace Corps Cambodia currently has two technical projects: English Teaching and Teacher Training, which started in 2007, and Community Health Education, which launched in 2010. Please contact us if your school or health center is interested in working with one of our Volunteers. 

Volunteers join the Peace Corps from every walk of life and represent the diversity of the United States. They can be any age, religion, or ethnicity and may come to the Cambodia with vastly different skills and experience. They join for different reasons: to gain work experience, to share their skills, to learn about the world, and to make a positive difference. But they have one thing in common: a sincere desire to learn about Cambodia and Cambodians.

It was a simple structure manned by a single keeper and sparsely equipped. In case of an emergency, the keeper had to rouse a volunteer crew before any rescue attempt. In 1892, Station Coos Bay was moved from the lighthouse to the North Spit of Coos Bay and was a fully manned station. The station moved again in 1915. This time it moved from the North Spit to the lee side of Coos Head promontory. A larger station was built consisting of a main administration building and quarters, a boathouse, a workshop and one house reserved for the officerin charge.

209356,Peace Corps The Gambia,peacecorpsthegambia,facebook,The official page of Peace Corps The Gambia. Make the most of your world. Share your story with #peacecorpsthegambia,"Since 1967 more than 1,700 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in The Gambia. Currently around 90 volunteers serve in one of three technical sectors: Education, Health, and Environment. Due to the size of The Gambia (it is the smallest country in mainland Africa) volunteers are able to collaborate on many projects, with particularly strong cross-sector initiatives in the areas of Gender-and-Development (GAD) and Food Security.

Peace Corps Volunteers come from diverse backgrounds in the United States. They represent a wide range of ages, religions, and ethnicities, and have vastly differing skills and experience. But they have all come with one thing in common: they want to learn about The Gambia and Gambians and share their skills to effect change.

Almost every Peace Corps Volunteer in The Gambia lives with a host family in a mud or concrete block compound. This proximity, sharing meals and becoming part of a family, helps volunteers to learn Gambian culture and language and to develop close ties to their communities – an integral factor in the development work that they undertake.

Take a look at some of the projects we’re involved in – we’ll update our Facebook page with stories, pictures, news articles, and Peace Corps events.

The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The President, with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, appoints the Comptroller to head the agency for a five-year term.

Bush created the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005, when malaria was almost certainly a death sentence for poor children in Africa. President Barack Obama embraced the effort and also significantly expanded PMI’s program reach. And, bipartisan leadership from the House and Senate has sustained our work. With PMI support, hundreds of millions of people have benefited from protective measures and have been diagnosed and treated for malaria. Malaria’s impact is especially ferocious on the poorest: those least able to afford preventive measures and medical treatment. Thus, PMI has reached into the poorest of communities in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria flourishes, arming women, children, and families with tools to protect themselves from malaria and providing them with fast-acting medicines to cure malaria if they do become infected. PMI has also brought much needed attention to address drug resistant malaria in the Asia’s Mekong region. PMI has programs in 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and three countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia.
