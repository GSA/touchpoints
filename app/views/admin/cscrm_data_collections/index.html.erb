  Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program Capability and Maturity: Self-Assessment
</div>

<p>
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all executive branch agencies to report on the status of their
  implementation of C-SCRM foundational elements and practices by completing and submitting this C-SCRM self-assessment,
  in accordance with statutory requirements noted below
</p>

<p>
  Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, Title II of Strengthening and Enhancing
  Cyber-capabilities by Utilizing Risk Exposure (SECURE) Technology Act (P.L.115–390, December 21, 2018) (PUBL390.PS
  (congress.gov) executive branch agencies are responsible for assessing and managing their cybersecurity supply chain
  risks, consistent with NIST standards, guidelines, and practices. In addition, the statute requires agencies to report
  on C-SCRM progress and effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
  This initial reporting requirement is scoped and structured to limit the reporting burden while ensuring agencies
  provide information OMB needs to gain a baseline understanding of agencies’ current status in establishing a C-SCRM
  program capability. Information submitted will enable OMB to gain actionable insights into agency-specific and systemic
  challenges that may be hindering progress and inform the plans, actions, and decisions needed to resolve these
  challenges. Establishing and maturing a C-SCRM capability requires a transition away from a compliance-mindset and
  towards establishing, sustaining, and maturing an effective enterprise-wide C-SCRM capability that is sufficiently
  resourced, risk-based, and outcome-oriented.
</p>

<p>
  This integrated data collection (IDC) instruction provides the criteria, format, and mechanisms for Federal executive
  agencies to submit their bi-annual information collection submissions. The initial collection in February 2023, will
  serve as a baseline, upon which to expand in subsequent reporting cycles.
</p>

<p>
  To aid in the completion of their C-SCRM capability self-assessment, agencies should refer to FAQs maintained at [link].
</p>

<p>
  If there are additional agency questions, please submit to <a href="mailto:MBX.OMB.FASC@omb.eop.gov">MBX.OMB.FASC@omb.eop.gov</a>.

<p>
  Direction:
  To determine the self-assessment responses for the measurement of foundational enterprise-wide C-SCRM capabilities,
  agencies shall:
</p>

<p>
  <ol class="usa-list">
    <li>
      Take steps to ensure responses submitted reflect an appropriate level of and span of internally coordinated input;
    </li>
    <li>
      Assess the status of their implementation and application of the foundational practices as described in National
      Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-161 Rev. 1 Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management for Systems and
      Organizations, May 2022 (SP 800-161 Rev. 1, C-SCRM Practices for Systems and Organizations | CSRC (nist.gov);
    </li>
    <li>
      Reference foundational practices and recommendations described in Information Technology: Federal Agencies Need to
      Take Urgent Action to Manage Supply Chain Risks, GAO-21-171, December 2020 (Information Technology: Federal Agencies
      Need to Take Urgent Action to Manage Supply Chain Risks | U.S. GAO); and
    </li>
    <li>
      Report self-assessment data semi-annually through GSA’s Touchpoints application, (HERE).
      OMB may change the vehicle for collecting this information, if changes are made, announcements will be communicated to
      the Agency C-SCRM Program Manager.
    </li>
