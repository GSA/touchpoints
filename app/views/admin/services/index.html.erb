      Managing Services in Touchpoints
    </h3>
    <div class="usa-summary-box__text">
      <p>
        Touchpoints is designed to support continuous improvement in how public services are designed, delivery, measured.
        Services are delivered internally within an agency, between agencies, and to the public.
        Services consist of people or systems performing work in a sequence of (sometimes conditional) steps
        to deliver value for other people.
        Services can be modeled, to gain more insight during design and measurement of a service.
        Consider using
         <%= link_to "human-centered design methods", "https://methods.18f.gov/", target: "_blank" %>
        to ensure products and services deliver value to users.

          and these services can access OMB Quarterly CX Data Reporting.

        <li>
          But any Service can be created and tracked here to support a Service Inventory or Catalog.
