    3B. Additional Checklist for Benefits Service
  </h3>

  <p>
    Required action. If your service has the administrative barrier, type X before checkbox and follow up with an explanation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    Excessive documentation requirements are a substantial roadblock limiting access to crucial programs and services. Such barriers are also often unnecessary, such as requiring that low-income individuals document assets they are unlikely to have. Indeed, documenting assets is one of the largest barriers people face when trying to access needed benefits. Other documentation barriers may be related to requiring the claimant generate records from third-parties.

    Complicated forms or eligibility formulas that require people to compile nuanced and complicated information and documentation negatively affect access by increasing compliance and psychological costs.

    Lack of knowledge about programs and their value includes those who are unaware of programs, mistakenly believe they are not eligible or underestimating their value.

  <p>
    If you checked the box, please explain
  </p>
  <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80" class="usa-textarea"></textarea>

  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    In-person interviews for eligibility or recertification purposes reduce access because of transportation, child care, and work scheduling issues for low wage workers.

    If you checked the box, please explain
  </p>
  <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80" class="usa-textarea"></textarea>

  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    Providing only one mode, such as the internet, for benefit applications, updates, and recertification. Online enrollment portals improve program access. But many low-income individuals, elderly individuals, and rural populations lack access to regular internet and broadband, or have limited technological literacy. Conversely, as noted, requiring access to be in-person or requiring pen-and-ink signatures can create other barriers.

  </p>
  <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80" class="usa-textarea"></textarea>

  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    Frequent recertification to maintain program eligibility, such as 6 months versus 12 months, increases the likelihood that individuals lose benefits because they fail to fulfill administrative requirements rather than that they become ineligible. Routine post-award reporting requirements, such as having to report changes in the income, employment status, or household arrangements, can also reduce continued participation in benefits programs.

    If you checked the box, please explain
  </p>
  <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="80" class="usa-textarea"></textarea>

  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    Restricting post-award communication and notices regarding beneficiary requirements or recertifications to the minimum required by statute or regulation. Many benefits programs provide mail-based notice regarding upcoming recertification requirements. A single point-of-contact via a single mode will not maximize the likelihood of successful recertification, especially for beneficiaries who may have changed addresses or other contact information. Proactively working to maintain contact information for housing insecure populations, as well as follow-up notices via phone calls, text messages, and potentially site visits, can help reduce loss-of-benefits due to failure to cooperate.
