      Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program Capability and Maturity: Self-Assessment
    </h3>
      <p>
      This is the 2nd iteration of the C-SCRM Data Collection, for August 2023.
    </p>
    <div class="usa-summary-box__text">
      <p>
        The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires all executive branch agencies to report on the status of their
        implementation of C-SCRM foundational elements and practices by completing and submitting this C-SCRM self-assessment,
        in accordance with statutory requirements noted below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, Title II of Strengthening and Enhancing
        Cyber-capabilities by Utilizing Risk Exposure (SECURE) Technology Act (P.L.115–390, December 21, 2018) (PUBL390.PS
        (congress.gov) executive branch agencies are responsible for assessing and managing their cybersecurity supply chain
        risks, consistent with NIST standards, guidelines, and practices. In addition, the statute requires agencies to report
        on C-SCRM progress and effectiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This initial reporting requirement is scoped and structured to limit the reporting burden while ensuring agencies
        provide information OMB needs to gain a baseline understanding of agencies’ current status in establishing a C-SCRM
        program capability. Information submitted will enable OMB to gain actionable insights into agency-specific and
        systemic
        challenges that may be hindering progress and inform the plans, actions, and decisions needed to resolve these
        challenges. Establishing and maturing a C-SCRM capability requires a transition away from a compliance-mindset and
        towards establishing, sustaining, and maturing an effective enterprise-wide C-SCRM capability that is sufficiently
        resourced, risk-based, and outcome-oriented.
      </p>

      <p>
        This integrated data collection (IDC) instruction provides the criteria, format, and mechanisms for Federal executive
        agencies to submit their bi-annual information collection submissions. The initial collection in February 2023, will
        serve as a baseline, upon which to expand in subsequent reporting cycles.
      </p>

  Direction:
  To determine the self-assessment responses for the measurement of foundational enterprise-wide C-SCRM capabilities,
  agencies shall:
</p>

<p>
  <ol class="usa-list">
    <li>
      Take steps to ensure responses submitted reflect an appropriate level of, and span of, internally coordinated input;
    </li>
    <li>
      Assess the status of their implementation and application of the foundational practices as described in
      <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf" target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-161 Rev. 1 Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management for Systems and
      Organizations, May 2022</a>;
    </li>
    <li>
      Reference foundational practices and recommendations described in
      <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-171.pdf" target="_blank">GAO-21-171 - Information Technology: Federal Agencies Need to
      Take Urgent Action to Manage Supply Chain Risks</a>; and
    </li>
    <li>
      Report self-assessment data semi-annually, here, in GSA’s Touchpoints application.
      OMB may change the vehicle for collecting this information, if changes are made,
      announcements will be communicated to the Agency C-SCRM Program Manager.
