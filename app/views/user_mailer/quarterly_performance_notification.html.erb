  Quarterly Performance Notification

<p>
  Hi <%= @cx_collection.user.first_name %>,

  I wanted to let you know that your CX Data Collection is available in Touchpoints.

  <a href="<%= admin_cx_collection_url(@cx_collection) %>">
    <%= admin_cx_collection_url(@cx_collection) %>
  </a>

  It is based on the previous quarter, and can be modified from there.

  Any questions, please let us know at feedback-analytics@gsa.gov .
